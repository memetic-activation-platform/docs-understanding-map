# 🕸️ MAP Agreements
### Interdependent networks of Promises that give rise to collective intelligence

---

## 🌐 What is a Promise Weave?

A **Promise Weave** is a **living network of Promises** among Cells that forms when:

- Multiple Promises are **accepted and activated**
- Those Promises involve **shared capital flows**, **compatible memetic signatures**, and **agreed protocols**
- The participating Cells consent to **relational interdependence** under shared governance

> 🌱 *A Promise Weave is how Cells self-organize into coherent systems of mutual support, purpose, and value flow.*

Promise Weaves are the **memetic and relational fabric** out of which **Agent Spaces** emerge.

---

## 🧩 Structure of a Promise Weave

Each Promise Weave is a **self-describing holon**, containing:

- `participants`: List of Cell IDs and their roles
- `componentPromises`: References to the individual Promises comprising the weave
- `sharedMemeticSignature`: Aggregated values and intentions
- `governanceScaffold`: Agreed decision-making and participation model
- `vitalCapitalFlows`: Flow map across Cells
- `thresholds`: Optional sustainability or trust bounds
- `protocols`: Interaction methods (e.g. MAPNative, Scuttlebutt, social ritual)
- `status`: Proposed, Active, Dormant, Dissolving, Archived

The Weave is **dynamic**: it can grow, split, merge, evolve, or dissolve based on consent and flow coherence.

---

## 🧬 How a Promise Weave Forms

1. **Initial Promises** are made by Cells (individual or collective)
2. **Offers** are extended and **Agreements** are signed
3. **Trust Channels** open and capital begins to flow
4. If:
    - Shared capital types are active
    - Memetic alignment is high
    - A governance scaffold is adopted  
      → A **Promise Weave is instantiated**

> 🧠 The Weave is not imposed — it *emerges* when coordination becomes coherent.

---

## 🛠 How Weaves Are Used

Promise Weaves are the **coordination layer** for:

- **Collective action** (e.g. stewarding a commons, launching a project)
- **Fractal nesting** (Weaves of Weaves form Agent Spaces)
- **Capital pooling** (e.g. mutual aid, land trusts)
- **Ritual practice** (e.g. storytelling circles, care rituals, governance)
- **Protocol integration** (automated or semi-automated services)

Weaves may be **public**, **semi-permeable**, or **private**, based on governance and membrane configuration.

## 🔄 Promise Weave Lifecycle

| **Stage**           | **Description**                                                |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Emergence**       | Sufficient trust, alignment, and active Promises trigger formation |
| **Activation**      | Weave becomes coherent: flows are live, governance is in effect |
| **Growth / Mutation** | Promises are added, roles evolve, new Cells join or split off |
| **Reflection**      | Periodic reviews, Life Code updates, realignment efforts       |
| **Dissolution**     | Flows end or diverge, agreements conclude, Weave archives itself |

Each lifecycle stage may emit **events** (e.g. `weave.activated`, `weave.split`, `weave.realigned`).

---

## 📊 Visualizing a Weave

In DAHN, Promise Weaves appear as **interactive constellations** or **weblike graphs**, showing:

- Participating Cells (nodes)
- Capital flows (edges)
- Agreement status (active, paused, at risk)
- Alignment resonance (color-coded or heatmapped)
- Promises as pulses or orbits within the system

This allows Cells to **sense into the health of their collective coordination** at a glance.

---

## 🔐 Governance of a Weave

Each Promise Weave adopts a **Governance Scaffold**, defining:

- **Decision-making modes** (e.g. consent, voting, delegation)
- **Role configuration** (e.g. steward, weaver, observer, membrane keeper)
- **Onboarding / exit** protocols
- **Capital balance policies**
- **Promise compliance / restoration mechanisms**

This allows Weaves to **self-manage** while remaining open to **evolution and divergence**.

## 🔗 Integration with Other MAP Structures

| **MAP Structure**      | **Relation to Weave**                                          |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cell**               | Cells are the agents making Promises within the Weave          |
| **Collective Cell**    | Emerges from sustained Weave coherence                         |
| **Agreement**          | Each Promise in the Weave is backed by one or more Agreements  |
| **Trust Channel**      | Controls visibility and flow permissions across Weave members  |
| **Dance Protocol**     | Defines how services, interactions, and flows are invoked      |
| **Vital Capital Flow** | The Weave maps total inflows/outflows across all members       |

### 3. **Nested Weaves**
How do Promise Weaves nest inside each other — e.g. family Weave inside a bioregional Commons Weave?

### 4. **Adaptive Governance**
How do Weaves evolve scaffolds in response to shifting flows and contexts?

### 5. **Public Discovery**
What visibility models allow Cells to browse or join Weaves, while honoring privacy and sovereignty?

## 🌿 Why Promise Weaves Matter

Promise Weaves are the **connective tissue** of MAP. They allow:

- Trust to scale without coercion
- Action to coordinate without hierarchy
- Capital to flow based on living consent
- Intelligence to emerge from interdependence

> The Weave is not just structure — it's **relational intelligence** in motion.

# 🕸️ Promise Weave Protocol Spec
### A coordination pattern for interdependent promises, capital flows, and regenerative governance

---

# 🔧 Promise Weave Protocol

A **Promise Weave** is a dynamic coordination structure formed when multiple MAP Cells enter into active, interdependent Promises that are backed by Agreements, aligned by shared values, and scaffolded by governance protocols.

The Promise Weave Protocol specifies how Weaves:

- Are formed, structured, and maintained
- Enable trust-based collaboration
- Govern shared capital flows
- Support emergence of Agent Spaces

> The protocol ensures that Cells retain full sovereignty while enabling coherent multi-agent action through consent, clarity, and contextual awareness.

## 📐 Core Protocol Concepts

| **Element**            | **Description** |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| **Promise**            | A unilateral declaration of intent by a Cell, possibly referencing services, capital flows, or access. |
| **Agreement**          | A consent-based contract between two or more Cells that activates one or more Promises. |
| **Weave**              | A holonic structure containing interconnected Promises, shared capital flows, governance scaffolds, and active relationships. |
| **Collective Cell**    | A higher-order holon that can emerge from a sufficiently cohesive and governed Promise Weave. |
| **Governance Scaffold**| A formalized structure for decision-making, participation, role assignment, and amendment within the Weave. |
| **Vital Capital**      | The value types (Human, Natural, Social, etc.) flowing across the Weave, tracked and governed in context. |

---

## 🧬 Weave Formation Protocol

1. **Promise Origination**  
   One or more Cells issue Promises (e.g. service offers, contributions, invitations) with compatible capital types and memetic signatures.

2. **Offer & Agreement**  
   Other Cells respond, forming Agreements that define access, expectations, and terms of fulfillment.

3. **Capital Flow Activation**  
   If reciprocal or networked capital flows are initiated (e.g. time-for-tools, care-for-space), the system qualifies for Weave formation.

4. **Governance Scaffold Adoption**  
   Cells adopt a shared governance pattern to steward the emerging relationship.

5. **Weave Holon Instantiation**  
   A `PromiseWeave` holon is created — self-describing, queryable, and visible through the DAHN.

---

## 🌀 Weave Lifecycle States

| **State**     | **Description** |
|---------------|-----------------|
| `proposed`    | Minimum viable Promises and Agreements are in place; governance is forming. |
| `active`      | The Weave is live — capital is flowing, governance is functioning, and Dances are happening. |
| `mutating`    | Promises or participants are changing, new thresholds or agreements being added. |
| `dormant`     | Temporarily inactive; agreements and flows are paused, but not dissolved. |
| `dissolving`  | Weave is being gracefully dismantled. Flows are stopped and roles exited. |
| `archived`    | The Weave is closed and stored for reference, with full provenance intact. |

Transitions between states must follow the governance scaffold's decision rules.

---

## 🧭 Roles Within a Weave

| **Role**            | **Function** |
|---------------------|--------------|
| `participant`       | Standard member actively offering or accepting Promises. |
| `steward`           | Responsible for maintaining the health, coherence, and thresholds of the Weave. |
| `observer`          | Has visibility into the Weave but no active Promises (used for mentoring, transparency, or governance support). |
| `membrane keeper`   | Manages visibility, onboarding/offboarding, and access requests. |
| `weaver`            | May introduce, refactor, or realign the structure of the Weave (e.g. roles, flow logic). |

Roles are defined and managed within the `governanceScaffold`.

---

## 💧 Capital Flow Protocols

All capital flows within a Weave must:

- Be **explicitly declared** in Promises and Agreements
- Reference **Vital Capital Types**
- Be optionally bound to **Thresholds** (e.g. minimum contribution, maximum usage)
- Be tracked and visible in the Weave Dashboard (e.g. via DAHN’s Capital Compass)

Example flow declarations may include:

```yaml
- from: cell:gardens.nora
  to: cell:fixit.tariq
  capitalType: Built Capital
  flowType: stewardship
  quantity: "4 tools"
  conditions: ["availableStock > 3", "trustLevel > 0.6"]
```

## 💧 Capital Flow Protocols

All capital flows within a Weave must:

- Be **explicitly declared** in Promises and Agreements
- Reference **Vital Capital Types**
- Be optionally bound to **Thresholds** (e.g. minimum contribution, maximum usage)
- Be tracked and visible in the Weave Dashboard (e.g. via DAHN’s Capital Compass)

Example capital flow declaration:

    from: cell:gardens.nora  
    to: cell:fixit.tariq  
    capitalType: Built Capital  
    flowType: stewardship  
    quantity: "4 tools"  
    conditions:  
      - availableStock > 3  
      - trustLevel > 0.6  

---

## 📏 Thresholds and Sustainability Metrics

Each Weave may define **context-aware thresholds** for its capital types.

- Thresholds are stored as holons and govern acceptable ranges of inflows/outflows
- A **Sustainability Quotient (SQ)** is calculated per capital type
- Flows are paused, rebalanced, or replenished based on these metrics

Governance rules may define responses to:

- Overshoot (SQ > 1)
- Undersupply (capital not meeting shared needs)
- Burnout (uneven Human Capital contribution)

---

## 🔐 Trust, Privacy & Discovery

Promise Weaves respect sovereignty through **membrane policies**:

- **Discovery visibility**: Public, local, invitation-only
- **Access rights**: Defined in Agreements or governance rules
- **Trust Channels**: Used to filter visibility and access to Weave elements

DAHN may allow Cells to:

- Discover nearby or aligned Weaves
- Request observation or participation roles
- View resonance indicators (memetic alignment, flow balance)

---

## 🔄 Mutation & Adaptation

Weaves are designed to evolve. Protocols support:

- Adding or removing Promises
- Reconfiguring roles
- Splitting a Weave into multiple threads
- Merging Weaves under shared capital/governance logic
- Amending governance scaffolds with consent

These mutations are logged in the `events` stream of the `PromiseWeave` holon.

---

## 📊 DAHN Integration

DAHN modules for interacting with Weaves include:

- **Weave Map**: Visual graph of participants, flows, roles, and resonance
- **Capital Compass**: Sustainability Quotient tracking per capital type
- **Promise Timeline**: Event log of activations, fulfillments, and changes
- **Governance Console**: Participate in decisions, proposals, and policy shifts
- **Memetic Alignment Viewer**: Shared Life Code and signature constellation

---

## 📘 Summary

The Promise Weave Protocol enables:

- Fractal, sovereign, regenerative coordination
- Consent-based, memetic-aligned relationship building
- Real-time flow awareness across diverse capital types
- Emergence of Agent Spaces through trust, not control

> A Promise Weave is not just a structure — it's a **living agreement space**, woven by intention, nurtured by flow, and sustained through mutual trust.
