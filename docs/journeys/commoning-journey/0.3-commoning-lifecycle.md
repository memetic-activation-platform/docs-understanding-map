## Remembering the Practice of Commoning

Commoning offers one ancient yet urgently needed pathway. Commoning is not merely resource sharing. It is the lived practice of mutual stewardship, relational governance, and shared purpose. It is the co-creation of systems where life, not profit, becomes the central organizing principle.

Commoning is older than markets. Older than states. It is rooted in reciprocity, trust, and the regenerative cycles of the more-than-human world. In a time when extraction and enclosure dominate, commoning reawakens the possibility of **nourishing what nourishes us**.

But how does a commons come into being? How does it live, adapt, flourish—or, when needed, complete its cycle with honor?

The journey that follows is a distillation of insights drawn from many modern stewards of the commons — including the work of Elinor Ostrom, David Bollier, Silke Helfrich, and others — interpreted not as a rigid framework or cookie-cutter recipe but as a living field of possibility.

## The Shape of the Commoning Journey

Each commons is unique.  
There are no formulas.

Yet across stories, a shared rhythm appears—  
a five-phase movement of becoming:

- **Inception**: The first spark of shared relationship and imagination.
- **Formation**: Weaving initial agreements, values, and early trust.
- **Stewardship**: Managing Vital Capital flows, promises, and governance with care.
- **Adaptation**: Evolving relational structures as complexity and scale increase.
- **Evolution or Completion**: Renewing, federating, or gracefully composting a commons.

These are not stages to be checked off. They are living movements within a regenerative field— emerging, converging, spiraling as life demands.

In the pages that follow, we imagine each stage of the commoning journey and how the MAP might support it.
