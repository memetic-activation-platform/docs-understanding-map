# MAP Journeys

The **Memetic Activation Platform (MAP)** is a living, decentralized coordination platform that enables people, communities, and ecosystems to **organize, act, and evolve** based on shared values, mutual trust, and regenerative flows of value.

As befitting any good map, the _Memetic Activation Platform_ supports **_orientation_** (where am I?
/ where are we?), consideration of potential **_destinations_** (where do I/we want to go?) and
**_route-finding_** (how can I/we get there?).

But the true power of a map is the journeys it helps you make. The MAP supports inner and
outer journeys of self-discovery, exploration, and innovation. And it helps individuals, find,
collaborate, cooperate, and co-create with fellow travelers.

The MAP is currently in proof-of-concept prototyping. This stage is ripe for sharing -— enough is solid to demonstrate how the MAP can tangibly support a broad range of endeavors. At the same time, the system remains flexible: open to feedback and ready to evolve. 

By sharing some possible journeys now, we invite others into a living co-design process—where the tools for stewarding the [commons](/docs-understanding-map/understanding-the-map/appendices/glossary/#commons) are themselves held in common.

We've included a small sampling of journeys here. What might your first journey be?

* [Personal Journal Entry](./personal-journal.md) -- A simple act — recording a voice memo — quietly updates your living salience landscape:  pulling together feelings, finances, upcoming events, and emerging practices into an **integrated, organic view of your life** —  seamlessly, privately, and meaningfully.
* [Web Conference in Flow](./web-conference.md) -- A single live meeting — grounded in shared principles, hosted within the Space membrane, captured and curated into living knowledge, and reflected back to the group in real time —  becomes a dynamic expression of collective coherence and care.
* [A Case Study in Shared Lodging](./sharing-lodging.md) -- This journey involves a real-life case study: sharing an Airbnb at the Cascadia Bioregional Conference. A grounded story with surprising possibilities.
* [Commoning as a Process](./commoning-journey/0.2-prologue.md) -- [Commoning](/docs-understanding-map/understanding-the-map/appendices/glossary/#commoning)—rooted in shared stewardship, mutual care, and relational governance—offers pathways for communities to regenerate life, rebuild trust, and sustain shared resources in ways that markets and states have failed to do
