# üß≠ MAP Documentation Structure ‚Äî Restructuring Plan

This structure organizes the MAP documentation into six core sections, each with a coherent narrative arc. It simplifies the overall flow while preserving conceptual depth and allowing recursive deepening through narrative holons.

---

## 1. üßç Agents and I-Spaces: The Sovereign Starting Point

**Motivation**: Person-centric architecture, data sovereignty, and local-first infrastructure

**Topics**:
- What is an Agent?
- The I-Space as sovereign computing and coordination environment
- Sub-agents (devices), membranes, and the role of Holochain
- LifeCode as personal memetic encoding
- The Data Grove as private knowledge and app data store
- Mapps and the MAP Store
- Global Service Registry and inverted authentication
- Example: Personal journaling mapp

**New Subsection**:
### üíß What We Flow: Vital Capital
- Introduction to Vital Capital as the meaningful stuff of life (e.g., trust, knowledge, care, materials)
- Why MAP tracks many forms of capital, not just money
- Very light typology (Natural, Social, Financial, etc.)
- Framing: This is what flows through Promises, Offers, and Agreements

---

## 2. ü§ù Relationships and Agreements: The Fabric of Coordination

**Motivation**: Moving from personal sovereignty to trust-aligned coordination

**Sections**:

### 2.1 Promises ‚Äî The Atomic Unit of Trust
- Promises as voluntary declarations of intent
- Promisor and Promisee roles
- Promise Types (Data Access, Service Availability, etc.)
- Promises stored in I-Spaces and selectively discoverable
- Promises as the building blocks of Offers, Agreements, Dances, and Agent Spaces
- Reference to Vital Capital (now introduced in Section 1)

### 2.2 Offers ‚Äî Structured Roles for Coordinated Action
- Offers as reusable coordination templates
- Each Offer defines a set of Roles
- Each Role defines Promises directed at other Roles
- Offers are shared into AgentSpaces for discovery, not tied to any space by default
- Role-centric, symmetrical design (no central offerer)
- Promises may specify Vital Capital flows (e.g., time, care, knowledge)
- Offers are composable, forkable, and discoverable

### 2.3 Agreements ‚Äî Shared Commitments with Trustable Memory
- When all required roles in an Offer are filled, an Agreement forms
- Immutable, signed commitment by all participating agents
- Agreement-Based AgentSpaces
- Agreement structure: Promises, roles, access control, thresholds
- Introduction of the 3-tier format (human-readable, machine-readable, legal-readable)

### 2.4 Vital Capital Flows ‚Äî Multi-Dimensional Value Exchange
- Promises in Agreements define explicit Vital Capital flows
- Rich typology (Natural, Social, Cultural, Experiential, Financial, etc.)
- Patterns: Gift, Reciprocal, Commons Contribution, Conditional
- Sustainability Quotients and Thresholds
- Dashboards in DAHN to track flow balance, overshoot, etc.
- Why MAP enables multi-dimensional value tracking instead of single-price abstraction

## 3. üï∏Ô∏è Promise Weaves and Agent Spaces

**Motivation**: Coordinating beyond the transaction ‚Äî forming living systems of mutual support

**Topics**:
- Promise Weaves: Emergent networks of aligned Promises
- Shared Memetic Signatures and governance scaffolds
- Weaves as coordination substrates for Agent Spaces
- Lifecycle: emergence, activation, mutation, dissolution
- How Agent Spaces emerge from sustained Weaves
- Governance: role scaffolds, onboarding membranes, realignment

---

## 4. üîß Infrastructure and Interface

**Motivation**: Coordinating at scale without platform capture

**Topics**:
- Self-describing, active Holons
- Dances as sovereign service invocation
- Uniform API: DanceRequest, DanceResponse, Graph-native invocation
- The Choreographer: sequencing dance flows
- Composable, membrane-aware protocols
- Visualizers and the Visualizer Commons
- DAHN: Dynamic Adaptive Holon Navigator for sovereign experience
- Inviting cultural and ritual customization at the interface layer

---

## 5. üß† Ethical AI, Trust Anchors, and Secure Coordination

**Motivation**: Sovereign-by-default infrastructure for human-aligned AI and trustable interaction

**Topics**:
- MAP as a RAG substrate: all holons are self-describing and permissioned
- Trust Channels and scoped information access
- The security model: inverted authentication, membrane enforcement, digital signatures
- Legal-readability and enforcement scaffolds
- Agent-centric service discovery and invocation
- AI assistants that can learn from LifeCode, not extractive surveillance

---

## 6. üåç Ecosystem Weaving and the Great Transition

**Motivation**: Scaling agency without consolidation or capture

**Topics**:
- Ecosystem model: Meme Pool, Service Registry, Visualizer Commons, etc.
- Empowered Agents Holarchy
- Self-reinforcing value loops
- The Great Transition: economic, cultural, ecological transitions supported by MAP
- Regenerative culture, bioregional agency, and pluralistic futures
- Participating in the co-evolution of MAP
