## üß© HolonTypes

| **HolonType**      | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Agent**          | Any entity capable of sensing and responding to its environment. It may be biological (e.g., a person, whale, or tree), technical (e.g., a computing process), or social (e.g., a family, cooperative, or commons).A sovereign holon capable of making, evaluating, and keeping Promises. Agents can be individuals, groups, or systems. |
| **Persona**        | A cryptographic proxy identity for an Agent, with its own keypair. Personas act as the public-facing participants in Agreements and Roles.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Agreement**      | A shared commitment between Agents (via Personas), usually granting membership and rights within a Space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Role**           | A named pattern of responsibility or capability within an Agreement, possibly linked to Promised or Permitted Dances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **RoleAssignment** | Links a Persona to a Role within a specific Agreement, indicating participatory promises.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **HolonSpace**     | A general-purpose container holon that defines a boundary for Holons. All Spaces in the MAP are HolonSpaces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **AgentSpace**     | A membraned HolonSpace for agents and interactions. May be an I-Space (HAS_I_SPACE) or a We-Space (if unanchored) (a.k.a., Space).                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Dance**          | A unit of action that can be invoked in a Space, typically governed by a Promise from one Role to another.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **TrustChannel**   | A TrustChannel is a membrane-bound communication interface, owned by an Agent, that acts in a specific Role within a specific Agreement. It is executed by the Agent‚Äôs ComputingNodes and inherits its authority via a RoleAssignment.                                                                                                   |

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy Architecture: How Personas Protect Agents

MAP introduces **Personas** as a cryptographic buffer between Agents and their actions. This is essential to maintaining sovereignty and defeating correlation-based surveillance.

---

### üîç The Problem: Correlation Tracking

Without separation of identities:
- All RoleAssignments point directly to the Agent
- Patterns of participation across spaces can be observed
- Behavioral, temporal, and network linkages enable tracking
- Agents are exposed to unwanted inference and profiling

---

### üß¨ The Solution: Personas

| **Concept** | **Explanation** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Persona** | A proxy identity with its own signing and encryption keys |
| **Agent** | A sovereign holon who controls one or more Personas |
| **Separation** | A Persona is the public actor; the Agent remains private |

---

### üîÅ Relationship Flow

```
Agent
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PERSONAS ‚Üí Persona
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ASSIGNED_AGENT ‚Üê RoleAssignment
              ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IN_AGREEMENT ‚Üí Agreement
              ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ASSIGNED_ROLE ‚Üí Role
```

### ‚úÖ Privacy Benefits

| **Property**                 | **Enabled by Personas** |
|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Contextual identity          | ‚úÖ Scoped to each space or purpose |
| Unlinkability                | ‚úÖ No shared identifier between Personas |
| Behavior isolation           | ‚úÖ Participation graphs remain disjoint |
| Revocable presence           | ‚úÖ Personas can be retired independently |
| Private agency               | ‚úÖ Agents stay hidden unless they choose to reveal themselves |

---

### üîê Cryptographic Design

- **Signing keypair**: used to authenticate promises and requests
- **Encryption keypair**: used to receive private messages
- **No link** to Agent‚Äôs master key or other Personas
- **All delegation and disclosure is Agent-controlled**

---

### üåê Summary

> **Agents do not act directly in the MAP.**  
> **Personas are their emissaries ‚Äî modular, revocable, and unlinkable.**  
> This makes MAP a platform where **privacy and agency are mutually reinforcing**.

# MAP Spaces

| **Space Type** | **Agentic?** | **Owned?** | **Contains Agents?** | **Acts as We-Space?**             |
|----------------|--------------|------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **I-Space**    | ‚ùå No         | ‚úÖ Yes      | ‚úÖ Optional           | ‚úÖ Yes (if it has sub-agents)      |
| **We-Space**   | ‚ùå No         | ‚ùå No       | ‚úÖ Yes                | ‚úÖ Yes                             |
| **Root Space** | ‚ùå No         | ‚ùå No       | ‚úÖ Yes                | ‚úÖ Yes (for all agents and spaces) |

## üßÆ Mathematical Functions and Relationships in MAP Schema Context

Let:

- `a` be an **Agent**
- `p` be a **Persona**
- `s` be a **Space**
- `g` be an **Agreement**
- `r` be a **Role**
- `d` be a **Dance**
- `ra` be a **RoleAssignment**
- `h` be a **Holon**

---

### üß© Core Functions and Logical Predicates

| **Notation** | **Meaning** |
|--------------|-------------|
| `M(s)`       | The set of Agents who are **members of** Space `s` |
| `C(s)`       | The set of Holons **contained in** Space `s` (via `HOME_FOR`) |
| `V(a, s)`    | Predicate: Agent `a` is **visible in** Space `s` |
| `I(a, s)`    | Predicate: Agent `a` has **interaction rights** in Space `s` |
| `St(a, h)`   | Predicate: Agent `a` is a **steward of** Holon `h` |

These are **derived semantics** built on schema relationships.

---

### üîÅ Mapped to Schema Relationships

#### Persona System

- `p PERSONA_OF ‚Üí a`  
  (*Each Persona belongs to one Agent*)
- `a PERSONAS ‚Üí p‚ÇÅ...p‚Çô`  
  (*Each Agent may have multiple Personas*)

#### Role Participation

- `ra ASSIGNED_AGENT ‚Üí p`
- `ra ASSIGNED_ROLE ‚Üí r`
- `ra IN_AGREEMENT ‚Üí g`

#### Agreement Context

- `g CONTEXT_SPACE ‚Üí s`  
  ‚áí **Derived Membership Rule**:
  ```
  If:
    ra.ASSIGNED_AGENT = p
    ‚àß p.PERSONA_OF = a
    ‚àß ra.IN_AGREEMENT = g
    ‚àß g.CONTEXT_SPACE = s

  Then:
    a ‚àà M(s)
  ```

#### Space Anchoring (I-Space)

- `a HAS_I_SPACE ‚Üí s`
- `s IS_I_SPACE_OF ‚Üí a`

#### Holon Location

- `h HOME_SPACE ‚Üí s`
- `s HOME_FOR ‚Üí h`

---

### üé≠ Role Capability Model

- `r PROMISED_DANCE ‚Üí d`  
  (*Role `r` promises to perform Dance `d`*)
- `r PERMITTED_DANCE ‚Üí d`  
  (*Role `r` is permitted to request Dance `d`*)

---

### üìå Notes

- Membership, Visibility, and Interaction are **derived states**, not directly stored
- `M(s)` is dynamically constructed from **RoleAssignments**
- `V(a, s)` and `I(a, s)` depend on:
    - Membrane rules
    - Role-based permissions
    - Explicit visibility declarations

---

| **Stewardship** | `St(a, h)` | Agent `a` is steward of holon `h`                     |

> **Note**: Membership is inherited, visibility is membrane-gated, interaction is Promise-based, and stewardship is explicitly granted.
