## üîÅ Matching Offers to Offers

In conventional platforms, we often speak of **matching ‚Äúneeds‚Äù to ‚Äúoffers.‚Äù** But the MAP model is more symmetrical: **every Offer includes both**.

When an Agent posts an Offer into an AgentSpace, they specify:

- **Which roles they are prepared to adopt** (i.e., which _Promises_ they are making)
- **Which roles they seek others to fulfill** (i.e., which _Promises_ they expect to be met)

You can think of these as:
- The **requirements** of the Offer ‚Äî Promises you are looking for others to fulfill
- The **contributions** or **attributes** of the Offer ‚Äî Promises you‚Äôre committing to fulfill yourself

For example:

> A **Grower** wants help assessing their soil‚Äôs capacity to grow heirloom tomatoes.  
> They publish an Offer with two roles:
> - **Grower** ‚Äî promises to provide samples, location, and context
> - **Soil Expert** ‚Äî expected to promise expertise, analysis, and recommendations
>
> The Grower signs the Offer in the Grower role and publishes it into a local regenerative farming AgentSpace.

Meanwhile, other Agents may have Offers advertising ‚ÄúSoil Assessment‚Äù services in the **Soil Expert** role. When the roles and promises across these Offers align ‚Äî a **match** can be proposed, negotiated, or auto-suggested.

## ü§ñ The Three Phases of Offer Matching

To support this matching process, a dedicated **Offer Matching mapp** guides Offers through three key phases: **preliminary matching**, **connection**, and **signing**.

### 1. Preliminary Matching (Anonymous Discovery)

Offers can be placed **anonymously** into an AgentSpace. In this phase:

- The **Offer Matching mapp** evaluates compatibility across all Offers in the space
- It highlights:
    - **Over-constrained Offers** ‚Äî too many requirements, resulting in zero matches
    - **Under-specified Offers** ‚Äî too few constraints, leading to too many mismatches

For example:

> ‚ÄúRelaxing the timing requirement or certification criteria would open up 3 more matching Offers.‚Äù
>
> ‚ÄúAdding a Promise around ecological region or method used could eliminate a large number of incompatible matches.‚Äù

The goal of this phase is to help Agents arrive at a **manageable candidate set** ‚Äî ideally **5 to 7 potential matches** ‚Äî while preserving privacy and agency.

No identities are revealed at this stage. Matching remains **possibility-oriented, not commitment-bound**.

### 2. Connection (Mutual Visibility and Alignment)

Once promising matches are identified, participating Agents may **move into a shared exploration phase**.

- Agents **reveal their identities** to one another
- Offers may be **fine-tuned** ‚Äî small adjustments made to better align expectations or clarify edge cases
- The goal is not full negotiation, but **adaptive convergence**: aligning Promises and roles just enough to lock in a shared commitment

This phase establishes the social and technical trust necessary to move forward, without rushing to finality.

---

### 3. Signing (Commitment and Activation)

Each Agent **digitally signs** the Offer to formally accept a specific role.

- Offers may specify some roles as **mandatory** and others as **optional**
- Once **all mandatory roles have been signed**, the **Agreement is considered Accepted**
- At this point:
    - A new **Agreement-Based AgentSpace** is instantiated
    - All logic, interactions, and capital flows are governed by the terms of the Agreement

> This phase marks the shift from ‚Äúprovisional possibility‚Äù to **active commitment**.

It also activates the Agreement‚Äôs LifeCode, access protocols, and any associated Dances or governance logic.

---

This three-phase lifecycle allows Offers to evolve from **exploratory expressions of intent** into **binding Agreements grounded in mutual trust and aligned Promises** ‚Äî all while preserving sovereignty, consent, and expressive nuance at every step.
