# 🧬 From Person to Planet: Sovereign Agents in Living Spaces

> In the MAP, we don’t build apps.  
> We start with sovereign people — and form living Spaces around them.

## Person-Centric, Not App-Centric

Today’s digital world is app-centric. Each application defines its own silo — controlling the interface, data, and roles. Your **identity, data, and experience are fragmented across platforms**.  You’re treated as a user — subordinate to software, not sovereign in your own digital world.

The MAP flips this model. It is **person-centric** — placing you, the sovereign agent, at the center. You establish your **I-Space** — a private, membrane-bound realm where your identity, values, data, and relationships live under your control. From there, you grow outward — entering into relationships, forming agreements, and co-creating new Spaces of shared purpose.

## What Is an Agent?

An **Agent** is any being or entity capable of sensing and responding to its environment. But Agents are not one-dimensional — they often span multiple aspects at once:

- **Biological**: bodies, ecosystems, watersheds
- **Social**: families, co-ops, bioregional networks
- **Cultural**: values, narratives, rituals
- **Technical**: services, protocols, bots

You are an Agent — a biological person. But so is a **bioregion**: it has living systems (biological), communities (social), stories and traditions (cultural), and supporting infrastructure (technical).

> An Agent is not a type — it’s a living whole.  
> It may express **many aspects** at once — biological, social, cultural, and technical.

Each Agent has an **I-Space** — a personal and private membrane-enclosed space where it expresses identity, stewards knowledge, and governs access.

## Anatomy of a MAP Agent

In MAP, every Agent is a living, structured whole — not a black box or a user account.

Each Agent is defined by a **membrane**, a **Life Code**, and a set of **internal structures and services** that support sovereign coordination and relational flow.

![Anatomy of a MAP Agent](83E53E44-855E-43E2-99AA-6C66E34CF25B.png)

- **Life Code (a.k.a., memetic signature)**: Encodes the values and identity of the Agent, distinguishing what is exhibited or inhibited in action.
- **Private State**: Includes private keys, personas, app logic, sub-agents, and notification logic — all managed internally by the Agent's I-Space.
- **Assets**: Holons representing forms of **Vital Capital** (e.g., money, attention, trust, food) temporarily stewarded by the Agent.
- **Service Implementation**: The internal logic or capacity that enables the Agent to transform or route Vital Capital.
- **Service Offering**: What is exposed to others — the flows and promises the Agent is willing to participate in through Agreements.

> The **I-Space** governs everything inside the membrane.  
> **We-Spaces** manage the boundaries and agreements *between* membranes.

## The Cell as Metaphor

A **Space** in the MAP is like a **living cell** — the foundational unit of life and agency.

This metaphor is inspired by Diane Tegtmeier’s *Principles of Cellular (Agent) Interactions*, which illuminate how living systems coordinate at every level. Each Space:

1. **Contains** — a membrane that defines an inside and outside
2. **Selectively Permits** — admitting or excluding flows based on consent
3. **Exists in Interspace** — in relationship to other agents across shared membranes
4. **Differentiates** — expressing unique services and capabilities
5. **Senses and Responds** — adapting to signals, context, and change
6. **Interdepends** — sustaining mutual health through cooperation and autonomy

![Principles of Cellular (Agent) Interactions](84EF9649-A316-4789-8B57-E5425434F43A.png)

Each Space in MAP embodies these principles:

- It has a **membrane** — governing flow in and out
- It carries a **Life Code** — encoding purpose, identity, and values
- It holds a **Data Grove** — its memory, relationships, and knowledge
- It stewards **Vital Capital** — energy, care, reputation, and resources
- It performs **Dances** — what it can do in relationship
- It evolves governance — roles, protocols, and decision scaffolds
- It expresses itself through **Visualizers** — ways of seeing, sensing, and interacting

> As cells form tissues and organisms,  
> **Spaces form social and ecological organisms** — living wholes that learn, adapt, and grow.

*Based on the “Principles of Cellular (Agent) Interactions” from*  
**Relationships that Heal: Skillful Practice within Nature’s Web** by Diane Tegtmeier.

## From Agents to Spaces

You are an Agent — a biological person.  
But you may also steward **sub-agents** — like your laptop, smartphone, desktop, or delegated services. These sub-agents operate within your sovereign boundary, coordinated through your I-Space.

An **Agreement Space** is a **membrane-bound collection of Agents** and the **medium of exchange** through which they interact.  
It enables flows of **Vital Capital** — including trust, knowledge, commitments, and resources — among the agents it encloses.

In MAP, Spaces replace applications as the primary unit of coordination.

- **Groups are primary.** You don’t join an app — you form or join a Space.
- **Governance is native.** Each Space defines its own decision-making logic.
- **Data is whole.** Your data lives within your membrane — not scattered across clouds.
- **Authentication flips.** Apps don’t authenticate you — *you grant them permission to act inside your Space*.

> In the app world, you log into them.  
> In the MAP, **they earn the right to work with you**.

## Spaces Are Holons

Every Space is a **Holon** — a living part/whole that:

- Contains sub-agents and nested Spaces
- Participates in larger organisms (e.g., coalitions, bioregions, planetary networks)
- Declares its own Life Code, structure, and capacities

Holons are **self-describing and active** — not just static data, but interactive, meaningful units in a living graph.

> A Holon is not just a record —  
> it’s a vessel of identity, interaction, and evolution in relationship.

---

## From I-Space to We-Space

Every Agent begins in their **I-Space** — a private, sovereign domain.  
But as relationships deepen and shared purpose emerges, **We-Spaces** are born.

We-Spaces are **AgentSpaces** — membrane-bound realms of shared intention, trust, and governance. They may be:

- A project team
- A co-op or DAO
- A bioregional network
- A family or movement

Each We-Space is capable of:

- Holding and managing **shared capital**
- Defining its own **Life Code** and governance
- Signing and fulfilling **Agreements**
- Adapting, learning, and evolving over time

## Agreements Open the Membrane

Spaces are sovereign — they don’t interact by default.  
Interaction happens through **Agreements** — consent-based bundles of **Promises** that define:

- Shared purpose and roles
- Permissions and thresholds
- Governance and capital flows

Each Agreement forms its own **Agreement-Based AgentSpace**, opening **membrane gates** between participants.

> The membrane is **semi-permeable** — allowing trusted flow, while protecting sovereignty.

---

## Assets and the Flow of Vital Capital

Spaces steward **assets** — forms of **Vital Capital** they hold in trust for members.  
These include:

- Knowledge, narratives, and software
- Attention, care, or reputation
- Ecological and material resources

These assets **flow between Spaces** through Agreements.  
MAP tracks the **digital representation** of these flows — but the flows are real.

> The MAP is not the territory.  
> But it makes the territory’s flows **legible, navigable, and actionable**.

---

## Fractal Holarchies of Coordination

AgentSpaces aren’t flat. They **nest and evolve**.

- I-Spaces give rise to We-Spaces
- We-Spaces may become **Social Organisms**
- Social Organisms participate in larger Weaves or Commons

This holonic structure supports:

- Scalable governance
- Distributed capital flow
- Interdependent identity and purpose

> From individual to pod to bioregion —  
> the MAP enables coordination across **biological, cultural, and technical layers**.

---

## A Living, Growing Tissue

Spaces divide, merge, specialize, or dissolve.  
They are born from **Promise Weaves** — networks of interdependent commitments.  
They evolve as coherence and identity deepen.

> The MAP is not a static architecture.  
> It is a **living tissue of Spaces** — constantly forming, reforming, and expressing collective will.

---

## Why Spaces Matter

Spaces re-center technology around living systems — not dead apps.

They allow us to:

- Govern ourselves — not be governed by platforms
- Own and protect our data — inside membranes we control
- Coordinate flows of value — not just money
- Express trust — not just permissions
- Build systems that reflect life — not extract it

> In a world of apps, you’re a user.  
> In a world of Spaces, you’re a sovereign agent, a steward, a node in a living weave.
