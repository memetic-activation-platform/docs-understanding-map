# 🤝 MAP Promises
### Consent-based coordination, powered by Promise Theory


MAP draws from **Promise Theory** (Burgess & Bergstra) — a model for cooperation in systems composed of autonomous agents.

**Promises** are the atomic unit of coordination — sovereign commitments made by one agent to another, forming the building blocks of all _Offers_ and _Agreements_.

Promises express intent, build trust, and establish the structure upon which regenerative flows can emerge. They are grounded in **autonomy**, **transparency**, and **contextual meaning** — and they are never imposed.

## 🔹 What is a Promise?

**A _Promise_ is a voluntary declaration made by one Agent (the *Promisor*) to another (the *Promisee*) about an intended action, contribution, or stance.**

Key components of this definition:

- **Declaration**: The promise is voluntarily expressed; it is not extracted by coercion or obligation.
- **Intent**: It represents what the agent intends to do, not what it is compelled or required to do.
- Promises are between a _Promisor_ and a _Promisee_. But the promisor and promisee can be the same agent (i.e., I can make promises to myself)
- **Autonomous Agency**: The promisor must have control over its own actions and is not subordinate to the promisee.
- **Concern Its Own Behavior**: Critically, promises are about what the _promisor_ will do. They are not statements about what someone else will do or what will happen in the world.

Promises are the core building blocks of trust, collaboration, and regenerative coordination in the MAP ecosystem. They define what flows, between whom, and why.

> Promises are not obligations imposed by others.  
> They are **agentic declarations**, rooted in consent and reciprocity.

## 🧠 Applying Promise Theory to MAP

 In Promise Theory:

- **Agents** are self-determined entities that can **make promises**, but not impose behavior on others.
- A **Promise** is a **unilateral statement of intent**: "I will do X."
- Systems form through **networks of promises**, not top-down control.

MAP adapts this foundation to:
- Extend **offers and agreements** between Agents
- Flow **Vital Capitals** between agents
- Form **Promise Weaves** — networks of interdependent Promises that give rise to **Agent Spaces**

Promises may be:

- **Actionable** — “I promise to deliver 10 pounds of produce every week for three months”
- **Aspirational** — “I promise to adhere to Permaculture design principles”
- **Informational** — “I promise to notify you within 24 hours if a service disruption occurs”

Every Promise contains:

- A **Promisor** (who makes the promise)
- A **Promisee** (to whom the promise is made)
- A **Promise Type** (a reusable, recognizable pattern drawn from the [Global Meme Pool](promise-weaves.md))
- Optional **conditions**, **timing**, and **qualifiers**

## 🧱 Promises as Building Blocks

All higher-order coordination in MAP is built from Promises:

- They are the semantic foundation of Offers
- They guide what becomes binding in Agreements
- They are the commitments that animate Agent Spaces
- They are what service interactions (Dances) fulfill

This architecture keeps the MAP lightweight, expressive, and trustable — with **Promises as the core semantic unit**.

---






> In MAP, a Promise is not a contractual demand. It is an **agentic signal of intent** — a memetic commitment made legible.

---

## 🔄 Reciprocal and Role-Based

Promises are often **reciprocal**: one Promise invites or implies another in return. MAP structures these reciprocal patterns explicitly.

Promises are scoped to specific **roles**. When an Agent accepts a role, they adopt the full set of Promises attached to that role — creating clear expectations and alignment.

For example:

- The **Provider** promises to deliver health diagnostics
- The **Patient** promises to provide access to relevant health data
- A **Third-Party Payer** promises to cover a portion of service costs

These role-bound Promises define the template for interaction and accountability.

---

## 💠 Promise Types and the Global Meme Pool

While each Agent is free to define new Promises, MAP includes a growing library of shared **Promise Types** drawn from the [Global Meme Pool](promise-weaves.md). These reusable patterns make Promises:

- Easier to understand and adopt
- Easier to audit and visualize
- Easier to remix into new Offer structures

Examples of Promise Types include:

- “Deliver Physical Resource”
- “Provide Access to Data Grove”
- “Honor Community Code of Conduct”
- “Participate in Review Process”

Agents may also co-create new Promise Types as part of evolving community norms.

---

## 🌊 The Flow of Meaning and Value

Promises are how meaning enters the MAP.

By making Promises, agents express who they are, what they value, and what they’re willing to stand for — in relation to others.

When Promises are made and accepted, they form flows of value — including **Vital Capital** such as:

- Time and attention
- Care and emotional energy
- Knowledge and data
- Stewardship of ecological or cultural assets

Bound together in Agreements, these flows form the **skeleton of regenerative ecosystems**.

---

## 🧬 Where Promises Lead

Understanding Promises is the key to understanding MAP.

They are:

- The **raw material of Offers**
- The **currency of Agreements**
- The **context of Dances**
- The **threads of Weaves**

> Start with a Promise, and the whole MAP unfolds.

For what comes next:
- See [Offers and Agreements](offers-and-agreements.md) for how Promises are structured into role-based coordination templates
- See [Promise Weaves](promise-weaves.md) for how Promises interlink across networks and time
- See [Vital Capital Flows](vital-capital-flows.md) to explore what Promises actually move

## 🧩 What is a Promise in MAP?

A **Promise** in the Memetic Activation Platform (MAP) is a **voluntary declaration of intent** made by a Space — an expression of what it will do, offer, or provide access to, under specified conditions and in alignment with its Life Code.

Promises are the core building blocks of trust, collaboration, and regenerative coordination in the MAP ecosystem. They define what flows, between whom, and why.

## 📄 Anatomy of a MAP Promise

A MAP Promise holon includes:

- `issuer`: the Agent making the promise
- `promiseType`: a structured interaction pattern
- `conditions`: trust, timing, availability, or Life Code alignment
- `vitalCapitalFlows`: what types of capital flow (e.g., knowledge, care, materials)
- `memeticSignature`: the values and intentions embedded in the Promise
- `revocationPolicy`: terms under which the Promise may be withdrawn
- `protocols`: the Dances and technical/social means by which the Promise is activated
- `expiresAt`: optional expiration

Every Promise is a **self-describing holon** — stored in the issuing Agent’s **Data Grove**, and shared selectively via **Trust Channels**.

## 🔄 Open Threads in MAP Promise Design

### 1. **Promise Life Cycle**
How Promises move through states:
- `issued → discovered → considered → accepted → active → fulfilled → expired/revoked`
  Each state may emit events (e.g., `promise.accepted`, `promise.revoked`).

### 2. **Promise Discovery**
Agents can discover Promises:
- Through **Trust Channels**
- By filtering for **Promise Types**, **Capital Flow Patterns**, or **Memetic Signatures**
- Using the **DAHN interface**, informed by personal or Collective Life Code resonance

### 3. **Promise Weaves**
When multiple Promises connect across Spaces with compatible flows and intent, a **Promise Weave** forms:
- The weave can become the foundation for a **Agent Space**
- The weave tracks interdependencies and emergence metrics (e.g., alignment score, capital balance)

### 4. **Promise Provenance & Integrity**
Each Promise includes:
- **Cryptographic signatures**
- **Version history**
- Optionally **observer attestations** or **trust level indicators**
  Promises are immutable once issued; amendments require new Promises or governance consent.

## 🧿 Why Promises Matter in MAP

Promises are how **agency becomes coordination**.  
They allow Agents to:
- Offer and request value **without coercion**
- Build complex collaborations **without central authority**
- Coordinate across **scale, trust levels, and cultural boundaries**
- Flow **Vital Capital** in transparent, trackable, and meaningful ways

> Promises are where **sovereignty meets cooperation**.
