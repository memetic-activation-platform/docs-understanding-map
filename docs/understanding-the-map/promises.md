# 🤝 2.1 Promises — The Atomic Unit of Trust

### Consent-based coordination, powered by Promise Theory

MAP builds its approach to coordination on a deceptively simple idea: **trust emerges from voluntary commitments.** At the heart of this design is the **Promise** — a sovereign, agentic declaration of intent.

MAP adapts insights from *Promise Theory* (Burgess & Bergstra), which models coordination among autonomous agents without coercion. But you don’t need to be a Promise Theory expert to understand or use the MAP. For Travelers engaging the platform, Promises are just clear, voluntary statements: _“Here’s what I’m willing to do”_ — expressed in a form others can see, respond to, and trust.

Promises are the **building blocks of all coordination** in the MAP. They underpin offers, form the foundation of agreements, and animate Agent Spaces with intent, flow, and relational meaning.

## 🔹 What Is a Promise?

A **Promise** is a voluntary declaration made by one Agent (the *Promisor*) to another (the *Promisee*) about an intended action, contribution, or stance.

**Key qualities of a MAP Promise:**
- **Voluntary** — expressed freely, not imposed
- **Autonomous** — issued by an agent with control over its own behavior
- **Declarative** — a statement of “I will…” rather than “you must…”
- **Grounded in Sovereignty** — even promises to oneself are valid (i.e. _“I promise to meditate daily”_)

> In MAP, promises are not obligations extracted by others — they are _agentic commitments_, rooted in consent and contextual relationship.

## 🧠 MAP’s Adaptation of Promise Theory

MAP extends Promise Theory in three key ways:

1. **Promises are self-describing holons** — they include rich metadata, conditions, capital flows, and provenance.
2. **Promises can flow between agents via Trust Channels**, selectively discoverable based on alignment.
3. **Promises may carry Vital Capital** — knowledge, care, materials, social trust — not just money or products.

Systems of coordination in MAP are **networks of promises**, not chains of control.

## 🔠 Example Promise Types

| **Promise Type**         | **Description**                                                                         |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Access Promise**  | “I promise to allow access to this type of information, under stated conditions.”       |
| **Service Availability** | “I promise to offer this service when invoked via a Dance, respecting flow rules.”      |
| **Presence Signal**      | “I promise to be discoverable in this context (e.g. locality, interest group).”         |
| **Reciprocity Pattern**  | “I promise to reciprocate a flow of capital if I receive another.”                      |
| **Governance Participation** | “I promise to participate in decisions, votes, or rituals under this scaffold.”    |
| **Contribution Offer**   | “I promise to contribute time, labor, or knowledge to an Agent Space.”                 |
| **Trust Declaration**    | “I promise to recognize another Agent in a specific role or domain.”                    |
| **Co-Creation Commitment**| “I promise to help create a shared output, resource, or experience.”                  |

## 🕸️ From Promises to Coordination

While individual Promises express intent, MAP enables Agents to bundle them into structured **Offers** — shareable invitations to collaborate, contribute, or exchange. Offers make Promises actionable in social space, introducing conditions, expectations, and context for uptake.
