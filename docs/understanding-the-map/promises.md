# 🤝 2.1 Promises — The Atomic Unit of Trust

### Consent-based coordination, powered by Promise Theory

MAP builds its approach to coordination on a deceptively simple idea: **trust emerges from voluntary commitments.** At the heart of this design is the **Promise** — a sovereign, agentic declaration of intent.

MAP adapts insights from *Promise Theory* (Burgess & Bergstra), which models coordination among autonomous agents without coercion. But you don’t need to be a Promise Theory expert to understand or use the MAP. For Travelers engaging the platform, Promises are just clear, voluntary statements: _“Here’s what I’m willing to do”_ — expressed in a form others can see, respond to, and trust.

Promises are the **building blocks of all coordination** in the MAP. They underpin offers, form the foundation of agreements, and animate Agent Spaces with intent, flow, and relational meaning.

## 🔹 What Is a Promise?

A **Promise** is a voluntary declaration made by one Agent (the *Promisor*) to another (the *Promisee*) about an intended action, contribution, or stance.

**Key qualities of a MAP Promise:**
- **Voluntary** — expressed freely, not imposed
- **Autonomous** — issued by an agent with control over its own behavior
- **Declarative** — a statement of “I will…” rather than “you must…”
- **Grounded in Sovereignty** — even promises to oneself are valid (i.e. _“I promise to meditate daily”_)

> In MAP, promises are not obligations extracted by others — they are _agentic commitments_, rooted in consent and contextual relationship.

# 🧠 MAP’s Adaptation of Promise Theory

MAP builds on Promise Theory, embedding it within a dynamic architecture of agent-centric coordination. Key adaptations include:

1. **Offers bundle Promises** — Each Offer is a holon that contains one or more Promises, along with conditions, roles, and expectations. Once accepted, these Promises are crystallized into Agreements.

2. **Agreements govern fulfillment** — An Agreement defines the reciprocal commitments between agents and governs when and how Promises must be honored.

3. **DanceRequests and DanceResponses flow through TrustChannels** — These are the actual units of interaction. They carry references to Agreements and include Vital Capital — such as knowledge, care, effort, or digital resources — as payloads.

4. **TrustChannels serve as membrane-bound interfaces** — They expose specific roles within Agreements, allowing agents to engage through defined protocols while preserving sovereignty.

MAP shifts the foundation of coordination away from control hierarchies and toward **networks of reciprocal Promises, formalized in Agreements, and enacted through Dances.**

## 🔠 Example Promise Types

| **Promise Type**             | **Description**                                                                    |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Access Promise**      | “I promise to allow access to this type of information, under stated conditions.”  |
| **Service Availability**     | “I promise to offer this service when invoked via a Dance, respecting flow rules.” |
| **Presence Signal**          | “I promise to be discoverable in this context (e.g. locality, interest group).”    |
| **Reciprocity Pattern**      | “I promise to reciprocate a flow of capital if I receive another.”                 |
| **Governance Participation** | “I promise to participate in decisions, votes, or rituals under this scaffold.”    |
| **Contribution Offer**       | “I promise to contribute time, labor, or knowledge to an Agent Space.”             |
| **Trust Declaration**        | “I promise to recognize another Agent in a specific role or domain.”               |
| **Co-Creation Commitment**   | “I promise to help create a shared output, resource, or experience.”               |

## 🕸️ From Promises to Coordination

While individual Promises express intent, MAP enables Agents to bundle them into structured **Offers** — shareable invitations to collaborate, contribute, or exchange. Offers make Promises actionable in social space, introducing conditions, expectations, and context for uptake.
