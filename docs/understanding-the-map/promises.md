# ü§ù MAP Promises
### Consent-based coordination, powered by Promise Theory


MAP draws from **Promise Theory** (Burgess & Bergstra) ‚Äî a model for cooperation in systems composed of autonomous agents.

**Promises** are the atomic unit of coordination ‚Äî sovereign commitments made by one agent to another, forming the building blocks of all _Offers_ and _Agreements_.

Promises express intent, build trust, and establish the structure upon which regenerative flows can emerge. They are grounded in **autonomy**, **transparency**, and **contextual meaning** ‚Äî and they are never imposed.

## üîπ What is a Promise?

**A _Promise_ is a voluntary declaration made by one Agent (the *Promisor*) to another (the *Promisee*) about an intended action, contribution, or stance.**

Key components of this definition:

- **Declaration**: The promise is voluntarily expressed; it is not extracted by coercion or obligation.
- **Intent**: It represents what the agent intends to do, not what it is compelled or required to do.
- Promises are between a _Promisor_ and a _Promisee_. But the promisor and promisee can be the same agent (i.e., I can make promises to myself)
- **Autonomous Agency**: The promisor must have control over its own actions and is not subordinate to the promisee.
- **Concern Its Own Behavior**: Critically, promises are about what the _promisor_ will do. They are not statements about what someone else will do or what will happen in the world.

Promises are the core building blocks of trust, collaboration, and regenerative coordination in the MAP ecosystem. They define what flows, between whom, and why.

> Promises are not obligations imposed by others.  
> They are **agentic declarations**, rooted in consent and reciprocity.

## üß† Applying Promise Theory to MAP

 In Promise Theory:

- **Agents** are self-determined entities that can **make promises**, but not impose behavior on others.
- A **Promise** is a **unilateral statement of intent**: "I will do X."
- Systems form through **networks of promises**, not top-down control.

MAP adapts this foundation to:
- Extend **offers and agreements** between Agents
- Flow **Vital Capitals** between agents
- Form **Promise Weaves** ‚Äî networks of interdependent Promises that give rise to **Agent Spaces**

Promises may be:

- **Actionable** ‚Äî ‚ÄúI promise to deliver 10 pounds of produce every week for three months‚Äù
- **Aspirational** ‚Äî ‚ÄúI promise to adhere to Permaculture design principles‚Äù
- **Informational** ‚Äî ‚ÄúI promise to notify you within 24 hours if a service disruption occurs‚Äù

Every Promise contains:

- A **Promisor** (who makes the promise)
- A **Promisee** (to whom the promise is made)
- A **Promise Type** (a reusable, recognizable pattern drawn from the [Global Meme Pool](promise-weaves.md))
- Optional **conditions**, **timing**, and **qualifiers**

## üî† Candidate MAP Promise Types

| **Promise Type**         | **Description**                                                                         |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Access Promise**  | "I promise to allow access to specified types of information, under stated conditions." |
| **Service Availability** | "I promise to offer this service when invoked via a Dance, respecting flow rules."      |
| **Presence Signal**      | "I promise to be discoverable in this context (e.g. locality, interest group)."         |
| **Reciprocity Pattern**  | "I promise to reciprocate a flow of capital if I receive another."                      |
| **Governance Participation** | "I promise to participate in decisions, votes, or rituals under this scaffold."         |
| **Contribution Offer**   | "I promise to contribute time, labor, materials, or knowledge to an Agent Space."       |
| **Trust Declaration**    | "I promise to recognize another Agent in a specific role or domain."                    |
| **Co-Creation Commitment**| "I promise to collaborate on the creation of a shared output, resource, or experience." |

## üí† Promise Types and the Global Meme Pool

While each Agent is free to define new Promises, MAP includes a growing library of shared **Promise Types** drawn from the Global Meme Pool. These reusable patterns make Promises:

- Easier to understand and adopt
- Easier to audit and visualize
- Easier to remix into new Offer structures

Agents may also co-create new Promise Types as part of evolving community norms.

## üß± Promises as Building Blocks

All higher-order coordination in MAP is built from Promises:

- They are the semantic foundation of **_Offers_**
- They guide what becomes binding in **_Agreements_**
- They are the commitments that animate **_Agent Spaces_**
- They are what service interactions (**_Dances_**) fulfill
