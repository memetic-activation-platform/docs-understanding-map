# 🔁 MAP Uniform API: Dances as the Universal Interface
### A living, knowledge-graph-native protocol for activating agency

---

## 💃 Everything is a Dance

In MAP, every action — every invocation of service, affordance, or coordination — is a **Dance**.

- A **Dance** is the invocation of a Promise.
- A **Dance** is the interface through which an Agent interacts with another.
- A **Dance** is the language of agency across the MAP.

Whether requesting information, triggering a service, exchanging Vital Capital, or engaging an Agent Space — it happens through a **Dance interface**.

> A Dance is not just a call to an API.  
> It is a ritual of activation — formal, expressive, contextual, consent-based.

## 🧬 The Uniform API

The MAP provides a **Uniform API** — a unified interaction protocol that:

- Allows any MAP holon to expose **Dances**
- Supports invocation via a consistent, expressive pattern
- Leverages the MAP's underlying **knowledge graph architecture**
- Ensures **sovereignty-preserving**, **self-describing**, **revocable** interactions
- Integrates human-readable, machine-readable, and contract-aware descriptions

---

## 📦 Core Structure

Each **Dance** includes:

### 📨 `DanceRequest`
- A holon that contains:
    - The target holon (service, agreement, or Promise)
    - The protocol to be used (e.g. MAPNative, REST, JLINC, etc.)
    - Input parameters in the form of a **RequestBody**
    - Reference to any active **Agreement** governing the interaction
    - Optional Trust Channel or threshold conditions

### 📤 `DanceResponse`
- A holon that returns:
    - Output data in the form of a **ResponseBody**
    - Status, result codes, and potential memetic impact signals
    - Provenance signature, if applicable

## 🌐 Everything is a Knowledge Graph

Because every element in MAP is a **self-describing, active holon**, all requests and responses are graph-native.

- **Dances can be expressed in OpenCypher** (and eventually GQL)
- **Parameters reference properties, relationships, and holon types**
- **Agreements and thresholds** can be used to dynamically modify queries
- **Responses are linked subgraphs**, not just blobs of data

This means:

- A single query language can retrieve a Life Code, trigger a Capital Flow, or mutate the state of a holon
- AI agents and human Agents use the **same interface**
- DAHN visualizers can represent any interaction — because it all flows from holonic self-description

---

## 🎨 Implications for Visualization

Because all holons — and all relationships — are represented in the knowledge graph, a **small number of visualizers** can be used to render:

- People
- Projects
- Agreements
- Capital flows
- Governance processes
- Even DAHN skins and rituals

Visualizers are **context-aware** — they adapt based on type, role, trust level, and dance state.

> What you see is what you can Dance with.  
> What you Dance with changes how you see.

## 🤖 Implications for AI & RAG Architectures

The Uniform API also enables MAP to serve as a **sovereign RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) backend** in AI systems.

- All holons are self-describing and queryable
- Trust Channels and Agreements define **information access boundaries**
- AI agents can be embedded in Agents, Agent Spaces, or DAHN modules
- Every response is **contextualized**, **revocable**, and **grounded in consents**

MAP becomes a **trust-anchored knowledge graph interface layer** for regenerative AI — one that honors privacy, agency, and mutual meaning-making.

---

## 🔐 Sovereignty by Design

- All requests are mediated through **Trust Channels**
- All flows are governed by **Agreements**
- All inputs/outputs are holons with **clear types, provenance, and constraints**
- All invocations are **revocable** and **context-aware**

> The Uniform API is not just a technical abstraction — it’s a choreography of consent.

---

## 🧭 Summary: The Uniform API is the Dance Layer of the MAP

- Every Cell can expose or invoke Dances
- Every interaction is mediated by a self-describing, semantic interface
- Every data exchange honors sovereignty, trust, and contextual governance
- Every tool and visualizer interoperates — because it’s all holons, all the way down

> MAP is not an app. It’s a dancefloor.  
> The Uniform API is the rhythm, the trust, and the invitation to move.
