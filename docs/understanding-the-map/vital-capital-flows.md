# 💧 Vital Capitals in the MAP
### Modeling value as flow in regenerative coordination

---

## 🌱 What are Vital Capitals?

In the MAP, **Vital Capitals** refer to the **core forms of value that sustain and regenerate life** — across human, ecological, social, and technological systems.

Rather than reducing value to money or static assets, MAP enables the **flow** of diverse capital types between agents — through **Promises**, **Agreements**, and **Consent-Based Coordination**.

> **Vital Capitals are the lifeblood of the MAP.**  
> They are what move when Cells make Promises, activate Dances, and join Agent Spaces.

MAP’s capital model draws from — and extends — the work of:

- **Context-Based Sustainability (CBS)** – *Mark McElroy*
- **Multi-Capital Frameworks** – in integrated reporting and ESG
- **Doughnut Economics** – *Kate Raworth*
- **Regenerative Economics** – *John Fullerton*, *Capital Institute*

These models offer a **multi-capital lens** for understanding value beyond financial metrics. The MAP evolves this into a **holon-native, flow-oriented implementation** where value is not just stored or measured — it is actively flowed, replenished, and aligned with context.

## 🧭 A Layered Landscape of Value

MAP organizes value across several layers to honor different forms of meaning, coordination, and measurement:

| **Layer**                            | **Definition**                                                                                | **Purpose in MAP**                         |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Relational Value**                 | Anything an agent or Space may care about — whether or not it’s modeled.                      | Philosophical grounding (not scaffolded)   |
| **Vital Capitals**                   | Declared types of value that may be flowed, promised, stewarded, or referenced in agreements. | Core MAP abstraction for coordination      |
| **Sustainability-Eligible Capitals** | Subset of Vital Capitals that are **measurable** and suitable for SQ computation.             | Enables contextual thresholds and tracking |
| **Assets / Resources**               | Specific, instantiable representations of value (where applicable).                           | Enables flow logic and operational roles   |

> Some Vital Capitals can be directly flowed or exchanged.
Others, like love, trust, or presence, are not diminished by sharing — they are **amplified through participation.**.

## 🔠 Vital Capital Types (Initial Set)

MAP defines a common set of **Vital Capital Types** to get started. Communities are encouraged to extend this list.

| **Capital Type**         | **Description**                                                       |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Natural Capital**      | Ecosystem services, land, water, air, biodiversity                   |
| **Human Capital**        | Skills, labor, knowledge, health, attention                          |
| **Social Capital**       | Trust, reputation, relationships, group cohesion                     |
| **Cultural Capital**     | Stories, rituals, traditions, symbols, identity                      |
| **Built Capital**        | Tools, infrastructure, digital systems, physical assets              |
| **Financial Capital**    | Currency, tokens, credit, investments                                |
| **Experiential Capital** | Aesthetic, emotional, and lived experiences                          |
| **Memetic Capital**      | Values, beliefs, narrative codes, memetic signatures                 |
| **Temporal Capital**     | Time, availability, scheduling of attention                          |
| **Spiritual Capital**    | Purpose, presence, connection to meaning (optional but supported)    |

> 🌿 **Extensible by communities** — define your own: *Ancestral Capital*, *Environmental Capital*, *Play Capital*, *Ritual Space*, *Silence*, *Emergence*, etc.

## 🧩 Functional Dimensions of Vital Capitals

Each **Vital Capital Type** can optionally declare **functional dimensions** — flags that determine which affordances are available within MAP.

These dimensions are used by DAHN, Agreements, Protocols, and Dashboards to dynamically offer appropriate behaviors.

| **Dimension**       | **What it Describes**                                      | **Example Values** | **Enables...**                                         |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `measurable`        | Can this capital be quantified?                            | `true` / `false`   | SQs, thresholds, dashboards, inventories               |
| `transferable`      | Can it move between agents?                                | `true` / `false`   | Stewardship, offers, exchange                          |
| `persistent`        | Does it persist over time (like a stock)?                  | `true` / `false`   | Stock/flow visualization, sustainability tracking      |
| `observable`        | Can others witness or attest to it?                        | `true` / `false`   | Reputation, trust, third-party validation              |
| `replenishable`     | Can it be restored or renewed after use?                   | `true` / `false`   | Regenerative flows, restoration rituals                |
| `formalizable`      | Can it be governed through structured agreements or logic? | `true` / `false`   | Policy constraints, access conditions                  |
| `tangible`          | Is it materially embodied or physical?                     | `true` / `false`   | Logistics, location, inventory                         |
| `symbolic_only`     | Exists solely in narrative, ritual, or symbolic space      | `true` / `false`   | Ritual flows, role enactment, presence rituals         |
| `depletes_with_use` | Is the capital diminished when shared or used?             | `true` / `false`   | Restoration logic, scarcity modeling, amplifying flows |

> 🧠 These dimensions **do not constrain value** — they simply inform **what kinds of interactions are possible** in software.

### 💡 Notes on Interpretation

- Some values (like **Love** or **Reputation**) are **non-rivalrous** and not depleted by sharing.
- Others (like **Time** or **Labor**) are **rivalrous** and must be carefully allocated or replenished.
- **Formalization** applies to resources that can be reliably governed by structured agreements (e.g. scheduling time, allocating funds).
- **Symbolic-only** value types enable ritualized or narrative coordination without needing measurable quantities.

## ⚙️ MAP Affordances Enabled by Functional Dimensions

The MAP Core provides a flexible scaffold for defining and coordinating Vital Capitals —  
but it does **not** prescribe fixed behaviors for all types.

> **Extensions to the MAP Core** (e.g. DAHNs, visualizers, smart agreements) may introduce  
> specific behaviors — such as dashboards, constraints, or rituals — **when certain functional dimensions are present**.

The table below summarizes potential affordances that can be layered on *if* the relevant dimensions are true:

| **Affordance**                     | **Requires...**                                  |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Sustainability Quotients (SQ)**  | `measurable: true`, `persistent: true`           |
| **Threshold-Constrained Promises** | `measurable: true`, `formalizable: true`         |
| **Stock Dashboards**               | `persistent: true`                               |
| **Transfer & Stewardship Flows**   | `transferable: true`                             |
| **Restoration Protocols**          | `replenishable: true`, `depletes_with_use: true` |
| **Observer Attestations**          | `observable: true`                               |
| **Ritual-Based Agreements**        | `symbolic_only: true`                            |

## 🔗 Example Holon Declaration

```json
{
  "type": "#VitalCapitalType",
  "key": "Love",
  "display_name": "Love",
  "description": "A generative, relational force that increases through sharing",

## 🪞 Summary

- **Vital Capitals** are plural, diverse, and community-defined.
- They are modeled in MAP as **flows between agents and Spaces** — not just static resources.
- **Sustainability Quotients (SQs)** are fully supported where appropriate, grounding coordination in CBS’s context-aware model.
- Communities can define their own capital types, declare functional behaviors, and use MAP to coordinate **what they value — in their own terms**.

> **Wealth in MAP is not what you store.**  
> It is **how richly and regeneratively you participate in flows** — and whom you nourish along the way.

## 📚 Acknowledgements

The MAP concept of **Vital Capitals** is directly inspired by the work of  
**Mark W. McElroy** and the **Center for Sustainable Innovation**,  
especially the framework of **Context-Based Sustainability (CBS)**:

> McElroy, M. W. (2008) [Social Footprints: Measuring the Social Sustainability Performance of Organizations.](https://research.rug.nl/en/publications/social-footprints-measuring-the-social-sustainability-performance)  
> [Essence of Context-Based Sustainability](https://www.sustainableorganizations.org/Essence_of_CBS.pdf)

MAP extends CBS with a holonic, flow-native, consent-based coordination layer —  
preserving its rigor while opening to ritual, meaning, and regeneration.
