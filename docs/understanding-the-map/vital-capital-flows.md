# 💧 Vital Capitals in the MAP
### Modeling value as flow in regenerative coordination

---

## 🌱 Why Vital Capitals?

In the MAP, any **agent can offer services** to other agents —  
and they can define their own terms by specifying reciprocal **promises**  
about what flows between the participants through the act of engaging in that service.

In most systems of coordination, value is flattened into narrow forms — usually financial.  
This reduces our capacity to name, honor, or exchange the full range of what we care about.

The MAP takes a different approach.

> We aim to support the richest possible spectrum of human and ecological value —  
> without collapsing it into a single metric or logic.

To do this, we introduce the concept of **Vital Capitals**:
- A **plural**, extensible way to represent what matters
- A **layered abstraction** that supports meaning, coordination, and measurement
- A **foundation for promises, offers, thresholds, and sustainability quotients (SQs)**

Vital Capitals make it possible to:

- Model **gifts, services, commitments, or contributions** — from **relational to transactional**
- Express **value flows** across **multiple dimensions** simultaneously
- Coordinate with **symbolic** or **quantitative** logic — or both
- Sustain **local ecosystems** through stock/flow dashboards and threshold awareness
- Extend value expression to **rituals, meaning, care, attention, trust, and presence**

MAP does **not** enforce one fixed ontology of value. Instead, it offers a scaffold:

- General enough for emergent use
- Specific enough for software coordination
- Extensible enough for diverse cultural, economic, and spiritual paradigms

> By minimizing ontological imposition, we **maximize expressive freedom** —  
> empowering communities to define, steward, and regenerate what they value most.

To support this, MAP introduces a layered abstraction of value —  
rooted in real-world flows, inspired by regenerative economics,  
and extensible enough to include both measurable assets and symbolic presence.

## 💧 What Are Vital Capitals?

**Vital Capitals** are the core forms of value that sustain and regenerate life —  
across human, ecological, social, and technological systems.

Rather than reducing value to money or static assets, MAP enables the **flow and recognition**  
of diverse capital types between agents — through **Promises**, **Agreements**, and **Consent-Based Coordination**.

MAP’s capital model draws from — and extends — the work of:

- **Context-Based Sustainability (CBS)** – *Mark McElroy*
- **Multi-Capital Frameworks** – in integrated reporting and ESG
- **Doughnut Economics** – *Kate Raworth*
- **Regenerative Economics** – *John Fullerton*, *Capital Institute*

These models offer a **multi-capital lens** for understanding value beyond financial metrics.  
MAP evolves this into a **holon-native, flow-aware model** that honors both **stock and flow**,  
**symbol and quantity**, **freely given and formally promised**.

In the MAP, every **Service Offer** expresses a form of value being made available —  
and that value is always described in terms of one or more **Vital Capitals**.  
Whether the service is a gift, a trade, a ritual act, or a formal delivery,  
it derives its meaning and coordination logic from the **capital(s) involved**.

📚 Curious about where the term *Vital Capitals* came from and how it found its way into MAP’s core vocabulary?

## 🧭 A Layered Landscape of Value

MAP organizes value across several layers to honor different forms of meaning, coordination, and measurement:

| **Layer**                            | **Definition**                                                                                | **Purpose in MAP**                         |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Relational Value**                 | Anything an agent or Space may care about — whether or not it’s modeled.                      | Philosophical grounding (not scaffolded)   |
| **Vital Capitals**                   | Declared types of value that may be flowed, promised, stewarded, or referenced in agreements. | Core MAP abstraction for coordination      |
| **Sustainability-Eligible Capitals** | Subset of Vital Capitals that are **measurable** and suitable for SQ computation.             | Enables contextual thresholds and tracking |
| **Assets / Resources**               | Specific, instantiable representations of value (where applicable).                           | Enables flow logic and operational roles   |

> Some Vital Capitals can be directly flowed or exchanged.
Others, like love or trust, can flow without depletion — they are amplified through sharing.
Still others, like presence or silence, may not flow in the traditional sense,
but can be held, invoked, or honored within coordination.

## 🔠 Vital Capital Types (Initial Set)

MAP defines a common set of **Vital Capital Types** to get started. Communities are encouraged to extend this list.

| **Capital Type**         | **Description**                                                       |

| **Experiential Capital** | Aesthetic, emotional, and lived experiences                          |
| **Memetic Capital**      | Values, beliefs, narrative codes, memetic signatures                 |
| **Temporal Capital**     | Time, availability, scheduling of attention                          |
| **Spiritual Capital**    | Purpose, presence, connection to meaning (optional but supported)    |

> 🌿 **Extensible by communities** — define your own: *Ancestral Capital*, *Environmental Capital*, *Play Capital*, *Ritual Space*, *Silence*, *Emergence*, etc.

## 🧩 Functional Dimensions of Vital Capitals

Each **Vital Capital Type** can optionally declare **functional dimensions** — flags that trigger specific capabilities in the extensible set of services offered by your fellow Travelers.

These dimensions are used by DAHN, Agreements, Protocols, and Dashboards to dynamically offer appropriate behaviors.

| **Dimension**       | **What it Describes**                                      | **Example Values** | **Enables...**                                         |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `measurable`        | Can this capital be quantified?                            | `true` / `false`   | SQs, thresholds, dashboards, inventories               |
| `transferable`      | Can it move between agents?                                | `true` / `false`   | Stewardship, offers, exchange                          |
| `persistent`        | Does it persist over time (like a stock)?                  | `true` / `false`   | Stock/flow visualization, sustainability tracking      |
| `observable`        | Can others witness or attest to it?                        | `true` / `false`   | Reputation, trust, third-party validation              |
| `replenishable`     | Can it be restored or renewed after use?                   | `true` / `false`   | Regenerative flows, restoration rituals                |
| `formalizable`      | Can it be governed through structured agreements or logic? | `true` / `false`   | Policy constraints, access conditions                  |
| `tangible`          | Is it materially embodied or physical?                     | `true` / `false`   | Logistics, location, inventory                         |
| `symbolic_only`     | Exists solely in narrative, ritual, or symbolic space      | `true` / `false`   | Ritual flows, role enactment, presence rituals         |
| `depletes_with_use` | Is the capital diminished when shared or used?             | `true` / `false`   | Restoration logic, scarcity modeling, amplifying flows |

> 🧠 These dimensions **do not constrain value** — they simply inform **what kinds of interactions are possible** in software.

### 💡 Notes on Interpretation

- Some values (like **Love** or **Reputation**) are **non-rivalrous** and not depleted by sharing.
- Others (like **Time** or **Labor**) are **rivalrous** and must be carefully allocated or replenished.
- **Formalization** applies to resources that can be reliably governed by structured agreements (e.g. scheduling time, allocating funds).
- **Symbolic-only** value types enable ritualized or narrative coordination without needing measurable quantities.

## ⚙️ MAP Affordances Enabled by Functional Dimensions

The MAP Core provides a flexible scaffold for defining and coordinating Vital Capitals —  
but it does **not** prescribe fixed behaviors for all types.

> **Extensions to the MAP Core** (e.g. DAHNs, visualizers, smart agreements) may introduce  
> specific behaviors — such as dashboards, constraints, or rituals — **when certain functional dimensions are present**.

The table below summarizes potential affordances that can be layered on *if* the relevant dimensions are true:

| **Affordance**                     | **Requires...**                                  |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Sustainability Quotients (SQ)**  | `measurable: true`, `persistent: true`           |
| **Threshold-Constrained Promises** | `measurable: true`, `formalizable: true`         |
| **Stock Dashboards**               | `persistent: true`                               |
| **Transfer & Stewardship Flows**   | `transferable: true`                             |
| **Restoration Protocols**          | `replenishable: true`, `depletes_with_use: true` |
| **Observer Attestations**          | `observable: true`                               |
| **Ritual-Based Agreements**        | `symbolic_only: true`                            |

## 🪞 Summary

- **Vital Capitals** are plural, diverse, and community-defined.
- They are modeled in MAP as **flows between agents and Spaces** — not just static resources.
- **Sustainability Quotients (SQs)** are fully supported where appropriate, grounding coordination in CBS’s context-aware model.
- Communities can define their own capital types, declare functional behaviors, and use MAP to coordinate **what they value — in their own terms**.

> **Wealth in MAP is not what you store.**  
> It is **how richly and regeneratively you participate in flows** — and whom you nourish along the way.

## 📚 Acknowledgements

The MAP concept of **Vital Capitals** is directly inspired by the work of  
**Mark W. McElroy** and the **Center for Sustainable Innovation**,  
especially the framework of **Context-Based Sustainability (CBS)**:

> McElroy, M. W. (2008) [Social Footprints: Measuring the Social Sustainability Performance of Organizations.](https://research.rug.nl/en/publications/social-footprints-measuring-the-social-sustainability-performance)  
> [Essence of Context-Based Sustainability](https://www.sustainableorganizations.org/Essence_of_CBS.pdf)

MAP extends CBS with a holonic, flow-native, consent-based coordination layer —  
preserving its rigor while opening to ritual, meaning, and regeneration.
