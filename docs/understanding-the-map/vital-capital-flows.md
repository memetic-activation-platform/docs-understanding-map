# 💧 Vital Capital Flows in the MAP

### Modeling value as flow in regenerative coordination

---

## 🌱 What is Vital Capital?

**Vital Capital** is what we **share, steward, and circulate** to sustain life and relationship.

In the MAP, Vital Capital refers to the meaningful forms of value that Agents exchange and care for — including knowledge, care, trust, time, materials, presence, and (when appropriate) financial instruments. It is *what flows* as via Services (as specified in Offers and Agreements), and *what is stewarded* within commons-based coordination.

> Vital Capital is the lifeblood of the MAP.
> It is what moves when Agents extend Offers, form Agreements, and participate in Agent Spaces.

MAP’s approach draws on multiple traditions:

* **Context-Based Sustainability** (McElroy), with its emphasis on threshold-aware capital stewardship
* **The Metacurrency Project**, where wealth is defined as *"the capacity to meet the needs of a living system"*
* **8 Forms of Capital** from permaculture (Roland & Landua), expanding value beyond the financial
* **Doughnut Economics** and **Regenerative Capitalism**, grounding value in planetary and social health

MAP unifies these insights into a **holon-native, consent-based value model**, where each Vital Capital holon can be tracked, exchanged, governed, and restored — within the relational flows of the commons.

## 🔠 Vital Capital Types

MAP supports a rich typology of Vital Capital. These can be extended by communities, but the core types include:

| **Capital Type**         | **Description**                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Natural Capital**      | Ecosystem services, land, water, air, biodiversity                              |
| **Human Capital**        | Skills, labor, knowledge, health, attention                                     |
| **Social Capital**       | Trust, reputation, relationships, group cohesion                                |
| **Cultural Capital**     | Stories, rituals, symbols, traditions, identity                                 |
| **Built Capital**        | Tools, infrastructure, digital systems, physical assets                         |
| **Financial Capital**    | Currency, tokens, credit — symbolic instruments that may facilitate value flows |
| **Experiential Capital** | Aesthetic, emotional, and lived experiences                                     |
| **Memetic Capital**      | Values, beliefs, narrative codes, memetic signatures                            |
| **Temporal Capital**     | Time, availability, scheduling of attention or action                           |
| **Spiritual Capital**    | Purpose, presence, connection to meaning                                        |

> 📘 *Note: While financial capital is included, MAP treats it as **instrumental** — a token that may enable Vital Capital flows, but does not carry intrinsic value on its own.*

## 🔁 Multi-Dimensional Capital Flows in MAP Agreements

Every **Agreement** in MAP is structured as a bundle of **Promises** made by each participating Agent, each of which can involve specific flows of **Vital Capital**. These Promises may reference different capital types — such as time, care, knowledge, or financial instruments — and together they define the **multi-dimensional value exchange** represented by the Agreement.

A Promise might say: "I will contribute 4 hours per week of mentoring (Human Capital)," or "I will share community data insights (Memetic Capital)," or even, "I will transfer 100 tokens upon completion (Financial Capital)." But it is the **collection of Promises** across all roles that articulates the full dimensionality of the exchange.

This is a core differentiator of MAP Agreements: instead of reducing coordination to a **single monetary price**, Agreements can specify **many types of value flows** in parallel — each explicitly described, contextualized, and governed.

Agreements may specify for each flow:

* `capitalType`: What kind of capital is involved
* `direction`: Incoming / outgoing (from the perspective of the Agent making the commitment)
* `quantity`: Scalar (e.g. 10 hours), symbolic (e.g. “ongoing”), or subjective (“sufficient”)
* `conditions`: Rules or thresholds that gate the flow
* `impact`: Intended or observed outcomes of the flow

This enables regenerative, relational coordination grounded in shared understanding — rather than abstraction into monetary equivalence.

## 🔄 Patterns of Flow

MAP supports several **flow archetypes**, encoded in Agreement and Promise structures:

| **Pattern**              | **Description**                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gift Flow**            | Unconditional giving (e.g. "I will share this value freely.")                     |
| **Reciprocal Flow**      | Mutual exchange based on parity or complementarity                                |
| **Mutualism**            | Coordinated flows for shared benefit (e.g. co-creation of a shared resource)      |
| **Stewardship Flow**     | One party promises to care for or maintain value on behalf of others              |
| **Commons Contribution** | Value flows into a collectively accessible pool                                   |
| **Conditional Flow**     | Value flows only if certain criteria are met (e.g. trust, role, proposal outcome) |

These patterns shape how Vital Capital is **activated**, **trusted**, and **restored** over time.

## 📏 Thresholds, Sustainability Quotients, and Dashboards

To support meaningful regenerative coordination, the MAP integrates key ideas from **Context-Based Sustainability (CBS)**, including:

* **Sustainability Thresholds**: Context-specific boundaries (ecological, social, economic) that define what constitutes a *sustainable state* for an Agent or Agent Space.
* **Sustainability Quotients**: Metrics that compare actual behavior to defined thresholds.
* **Dashboards**: DAHN modules that surface these metrics to support awareness, reflection, and adaptive coordination.

> 🧠 *An Agent Space is **sustainable** to the extent that its Vital Capital flows and stocks remain within the thresholds that define what it can justly and safely take, give, or impact — in context.*

### 🔹 What Is a Threshold?

A **Threshold** defines the **contextually appropriate limit** for a particular Vital Capital flow or stock. Examples include:

* **Ecological**: How much water can be used without degrading the watershed?
* **Social**: What level of care ensures dignity and belonging?
* **Economic**: What balances ensure resilience without extraction?

Thresholds are defined per capital type and may come from:

* Governance within Agent Spaces
* Commons stewardship principles
* Scientific knowledge or traditional wisdom
* Memetic codes embedded in LifeCodes

---

### 🔹 Sustainability Quotient (SQ)

The **Sustainability Quotient** compares actual behavior to the defined threshold:

* If SQ ≤ 1 → the flow is within sustainable bounds
* If SQ > 1 → the flow exceeds the sustainable threshold (overshoot)

Each Vital Capital type can have its own SQ, offering a multi-dimensional portrait of sustainability. MAP doesn't collapse this into a single score — it supports holistic, context-aware feedback.

---

### 🔹 Example: Water Use

* **Capital Type**: Natural Capital (Water)
* **Threshold**: 50L/day/person
* **Actual Use**: 40L/day/person
* **Result**: SQ = 0.80 → Sustainable (20% headroom)

In DAHN, this could be visualized as:

* A green arc showing 80% fill
* Narrative insight: “Usage within sustainable limits”
* Suggestion: “Consider contributing surplus to a commons”

---

### 🔹 Capital Dashboards for Every Agent Space

Each Agent Space — whether individual or collective — can activate dashboards in DAHN to track:

| **Dimension**                | **What It Shows**                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vital Capital Flows**      | Inflows and outflows by type and period           |
| **Capital Stocks**           | What is being stored, cultivated, or depleted     |
| **Sustainability Quotients** | Performance relative to thresholds                |
| **Trend Arcs**               | Direction and velocity of change                  |
| **Alerts and Prompts**       | When nearing or exceeding safe limits             |
| **Regenerative Insights**    | Suggestions for rebalancing or restorative action |

These dashboards are configurable and privacy-aware. They can be kept private for self-awareness, shared selectively with trusted peers, or integrated into governance decisions.

## 🧷 Conclusion: Why Vital Capital Matters

Most coordination systems reduce value to monetary terms, hiding the richness of what actually flows between people and across communities. The MAP elevates **Vital Capital** as a first-class, memetically expressive structure for meaningful exchange.

- It makes visible the many forms of value that support life and relationship.
- It invites regenerative action based on sufficiency, not extraction.
- It enables stewardship and reciprocity within the commons.

> MAP doesn’t just move information or money.  
> It makes it possible to coordinate around what really matters — in all its dimensions.
