✅ **Open-Ended by Design**  
The MAP isn’t just open-source — it’s **open-ended**.  
Its architecture invites continual extension by participants themselves: new memes, new governance models, new mapps, new ways of knowing and coordinating.  
Evolution is a feature, not an afterthought.

✅ **Pluggable Culture, Governance, and Protocols**  
Agents and communities curate their own values, principles, and practices — drawn from the evolving Global Meme Pool — without being limited by the imagination of the platform's creators.

✅ **Spaces Before Apps**  
In the MAP, you define your **Space** — its membership, culture, governance, and flows — and **bring mapps to your Space**, not the other way around.  
Your Space’s data lives on **your devices**, under **your control** — no more fragmented identities across dozens of app providers’ clouds.

✅ **Knowledge Graph Native**  
Everything — Agents, Promises, Agreements, Resources — is alive in an evolving, traversable sovereign knowledge graph.  
This makes the MAP a **first-class data source for AI, analytics, and collective intelligence** — ensuring that machine reasoning is grounded in human sovereignty, consent, and living context.

✅ **DAHN (Dynamic, Adaptive, Holon Navigator)**  
A modular, aesthetic, evolving interface that puts **you** at the center of your MAP experience — dynamically selecting visualizers and interaction modes based on your preferences and context.

✅ **Dance Interface Protocol**  
A simple, expressive, sovereign API that lets you invoke, share, and respond to actions and data access requests across the graph — with trust and meaning embedded in every move.

✅ **Evolutionary UX Commons**  
Visualizers and interaction gestures are **community-contributed and co-evolved**, allowing every ecosystem, every community, and every agent to shape their own way of seeing and moving through the MAP.
