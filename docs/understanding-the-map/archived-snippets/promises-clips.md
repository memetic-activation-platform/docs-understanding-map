## ðŸ”„ Reciprocal and Role-Based

Promises are often **reciprocal**: one Promise invites or implies another in return. MAP structures these reciprocal patterns explicitly.

Promises are scoped to specific **roles**. When an Agent accepts a role, they adopt the full set of Promises attached to that role â€” creating clear expectations and alignment.

For example:

- The **Provider** promises to deliver health diagnostics
- The **Patient** promises to provide access to relevant health data
- A **Third-Party Payer** promises to cover a portion of service costs

These role-bound Promises define the template for interaction and accountability.

## ðŸŒŠ The Flow of Meaning and Value

Promises are how meaning enters the MAP.

By making Promises, agents express who they are, what they value, and what theyâ€™re willing to stand for â€” in relation to others.

When Promises are made and accepted, they form flows of value â€” including **Vital Capital** such as:

- Time and attention
- Care and emotional energy
- Knowledge and data
- Stewardship of ecological or cultural assets

Bound together in Agreements, these flows form the **skeleton of regenerative ecosystems**.

## ðŸ§¬ Where Promises Lead

Understanding Promises is the key to understanding MAP.

They are:

- The **raw material of Offers**
- The **currency of Agreements**
- The **context of Dances**
- The **threads of Weaves**

> Start with a Promise, and the whole MAP unfolds.

For what comes next:
- See [Offers and Agreements](offers-and-agreements.md) for how Promises are structured into role-based coordination templates
- See [Promise Weaves](promise-weaves.md) for how Promises interlink across networks and time
- See [Vital Capital Flows](vital-capital-flows.md) to explore what Promises actually move

## ðŸ“„ Anatomy of a MAP Promise

A MAP Promise holon includes:

- `issuer`: the Agent making the promise
- `promiseType`: a structured interaction pattern
- `conditions`: trust, timing, availability, or Life Code alignment
- `vitalCapitalFlows`: what types of capital flow (e.g., knowledge, care, materials)
- `memeticSignature`: the values and intentions embedded in the Promise
- `revocationPolicy`: terms under which the Promise may be withdrawn
- `protocols`: the Dances and technical/social means by which the Promise is activated
- `expiresAt`: optional expiration

Every Promise is a **self-describing holon** â€” stored in the issuing Agentâ€™s **Data Grove**, and shared selectively via **Trust Channels**.

## ðŸ”„ Open Threads in MAP Promise Design

### 1. **Promise Life Cycle**
How Promises move through states:
- `issued â†’ discovered â†’ considered â†’ accepted â†’ active â†’ fulfilled â†’ expired/revoked`
  Each state may emit events (e.g., `promise.accepted`, `promise.revoked`).

### 2. **Promise Discovery**
Agents can discover Promises:
- Through **Trust Channels**
- By filtering for **Promise Types**, **Capital Flow Patterns**, or **Memetic Signatures**
- Using the **DAHN interface**, informed by personal or Collective Life Code resonance

### 3. **Promise Weaves**
When multiple Promises connect across Spaces with compatible flows and intent, a **Promise Weave** forms:
- The weave can become the foundation for a **Agent Space**
- The weave tracks interdependencies and emergence metrics (e.g., alignment score, capital balance)

### 4. **Promise Provenance & Integrity**
Each Promise includes:
- **Cryptographic signatures**
- **Version history**
- Optionally **observer attestations** or **trust level indicators**
  Promises are immutable once issued; amendments require new Promises or governance consent.

## ðŸ§¿ Why Promises Matter in MAP

Promises are how **agency becomes coordination**.  
They allow Agents to:
- Offer and request value **without coercion**
- Build complex collaborations **without central authority**
- Coordinate across **scale, trust levels, and cultural boundaries**
- Flow **Vital Capital** in transparent, trackable, and meaningful ways
