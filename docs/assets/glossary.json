  "this-glossary-defines-key-concepts-and-terms-used-throughout-the-map-architecture-and-narrative-framework-terms-are-listed-alphabetically-multiple-definitions-are-included-where-distinctions-emerged-between-narrative-threads": "---",
  "agent": "An Agent is any entity capable of sensing and responding to its environment. It may be biological (e.g., a person, whale, or tree), technical (e.g., a computing process), or social (e.g., a family, cooperative, or commons).",
  "agentspace": "An AgentSpace is a membrane-bound social space where [Agents](#agent) interact, co-create, and participate in regenerative value flows. It is simultaneously:",
  "agreement": "An Agreement is created from an [Offer](#offer) when agents have accepted all of the mandatory roles of the Offer. An Agreement may instantiate its own [Agreement-Based AgentSpace](#agreement-based-agentspace) which becomes the interaction venue for activities governed by that agreement.",
  "agreement-based-agentspace": "An Agreement-Based AgentSpace is a bounded interaction context that emerges when an [Offer](#offer) is accepted and an [Agreement](#agreement) is formed.",
  "choreographer": "The Choreographer is the MAP\u2019s native coordination engine. It manages the invocation and sequencing of modular dances across agents, spaces, and roles using declarative [Dance Flows](glossary.md#dance-flow).",
  "dahn": "A personalized, dynamic interface layer for exploring the MAP holon graph. DAHN empowers each agent to shape their own experience - not just by choosing settings, but by composing the very way information is seen, explored, and interacted with.",
  "dance": "A Dance is a named, invocable action that a [Holon](#holon) can perform or participate in - such as querying data, initiating a service, accepting an offer, or responding to a relationship.",
  "dance-interface-protocol": "The Dance Interface Protocol is the universal invocation protocol in the MAP. It replaces traditional REST or RPC calls with a more expressive, memetic, and composable request model.",
  "dancerequest": "A DanceRequest is a Holon-encoded invocation of a [Dance](#dance). It tells a Holon what is being requested - and under what terms.",
  "danceresponse": "A DanceResponse is the result of performing a [Dance](#dance). It includes not only the outcome of the request but also the forward affordances - what the Holon now makes possible.",
  "data-grove": "A Data Grove is the sovereign, Holochain-based data storage area. Each [AgentSpace](#agentspace) has its own private Data Grove. All of the [mapps](#mapps) that are imported into an Agent Space store their information in the Data Grove of that Space.",
  "exosphere": "The Exosphere is the outermost, most inclusive [AgentSpace](#agentspace) in the MAP. It includes all [Agents](#agent) by default and serves as the lowest-threshold interaction venue across the entire platform.",
  "holon": "A Holon is the foundational unit of structure, meaning, and interaction in the MAP.",
  "holonspace": "A HolonSpace is the foundational data container in the MAP, equivalent to an [AgentSpace](#agentspace). While the term highlights its function as a steward of [Holons](#holon), in MAP narratives, the two terms are generally treated as synonymous.",
  "i-space": "An I-Space is an [AgentSpace](#agentspace) viewed from the interior perspective - focusing on internal structure, properties, intentions, and affordances of an [Agent](#agent).",
  "join-membrane": "The set of rules defined by an [AgentSpace's](#agentspace) [Life Code](#lifecode) that govern adding new members of the Agent Space.",
  "lifecode": "A LifeCode (also known as a [Memetic Signature](#memetic-signature)) is the values-and-identity encoding of an [Agent](#agent), [AgentSpace](#agentspace), [Offer](#offer) or [Agreement](#agreement). It defines: - Aspirational purpose - Memetic values and ethics - Governance expectations - Membership criteria - Expressed [Promises](#promise)",
  "memetic-signature": "Synonym for [LifeCode](#lifecode). Refers to the expressive encoding of an Agent\u2019s identity, values, and memetic alignment.",
  "offer": "An Offer is a proposed bundle of [Promises](#promise), expressing both:",
  "promise": "A Promise is a voluntary, sovereign commitment made by one [Agent](#agent). It is the atomic unit of value coordination within MAP.",
  "service": "Services support the flow and transformation of vital capitals to/from other agents for mutual benefit. Services are the focus of [Offers](#offer), [Agreements](#agreement), and [Service Invocations](#service-invocation).",
  "service-invocation": "A request to an offering agent to perform a requested service within the context of an active agreement.",
  "social-organism": "A Social Organism is an [AgentSpace](#agentspace) that has developed enough internal coherence, governance capacity, and memetic identity to act as an [Agent](#agent) in its own right-a [Holon](#holon) one level up.",
  "stewardship": "In the MAP, stewardship replaces \"ownership\" to describe the relationship between an [AgentSpace](#agentspace) and the [Holons](#holon) it is responsible for. Each Holon is stewarded by exactly one AgentSpace, though it may be referenced in many.",
  "uniform-api": "The Uniform API is the singular interface through which all interactions with the MAP take place. It is based on the metaphor of the [Dance](#dance), framing every invocation - from data queries to service calls - as a shared, consensual interaction.",
  "vital-capital": "A core MAP holon type representing the diverse forms of value that can flow between Agents - including knowledge, care, trust, materials, attention, and more. Vital Capital is what flows as a result of service invocations and fulfilled Promises. While not inherently scarce or commodified, each Vital Capital holon is definable, describable, and context-aware. When under the stewardship of a particular Agent, it may be treated as an Asset. The concept draws from multiple sources, including Context-Based Sustainability (McElroy), the Metacurrency Project (which defines wealth as \"the capacity to meet the needs of a living system\"), and the 8 Forms of Capital in permaculture theory.",
  "visualizer": "A Visualizer is a Holon that describes how another Holon should be rendered and interacted with - in 2D, 3D, text, graph, gallery, immersive environment, or any other format.",
  "visualizer-commons": "A federated network of stewarded sets of [Visualizers](#visualizer). [DAHN](#dahn-dynamic-adaptive-holon-navigator) dynamically selects and configures visualizers from the _Visualizer Commons_ to present and enable interaction with the MAP' self-describing, active [Holons](#holon)",
  "we-space": "A We-Space is an [AgentSpace](#agentspace) viewed from the exterior perspective - how it participates within larger structures, how it exposes interfaces and affordances, and how it relates to other spaces."
