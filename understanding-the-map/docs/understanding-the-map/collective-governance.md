### Regenerative trust architectures for Agent Spaces

## üîß What Is a Governance Scaffold?

A **Governance Scaffold** is a reusable holonic pattern that defines how a **Space** self-coordinates ‚Äî how it:

- Makes decisions
- Onboards and off-boards members
- Resolves tensions
- Assigns and rotates roles
- Evolves over time
- Sustains collective intelligence

Governance Scaffolds are **not rigid operating systems** ‚Äî they are **living, declarative blueprints** grounded in consent, trust, and purpose.

> In the MAP, governance is scaffolded ‚Äî not imposed. It arises from relationships, intentions, and shared design.

---

## üß© Why Governance Scaffolds Matter

1. **Freedom of Choice**  
   Spaces are sovereign. They choose governance models aligned to their unique purpose, makeup, and context.

2. **Acceleration Without Lock-in**  
   Designing governance from scratch is costly and error-prone. Scaffolds provide ready-to-adapt patterns without restricting autonomy.

3. **Pluggable Memes and Methods**
    - The **Global Meme Pool** provides the governance goals, principles, and models ‚Äî the memetic source of "what" and "why."
    - The **Global Service Registry** scaffolds their *implementation* ‚Äî offering service mapps, templates, and consulting offers to operationalize governance.

4. **Living, Regenerative Ecosystem**  
   As Spaces implement, adapt, and remix scaffolds, they feed evolutionary insights back into the commons ‚Äî strengthening both the Meme Pool and Service Registry.

> **The Global Meme Pool inspires governance; the Global Service Registry scaffolds it into operational reality.**

## üìê Governance Scaffold Structure

Each Governance Scaffold is a **self-describing Holon** that includes:

- `scaffoldId`: Unique identifier
- `decisionModes`: Supported decision logics (e.g., consent, advice, voting)
- `defaultRoles`: Recommended roles (steward, weaver, membrane keeper, etc.)
- `onboardingProtocol`: How new agents or Spaces join
- `exitProtocol`: Graceful or responsive exit patterns
- `amendmentProcess`: How governance evolves over time
- `tensionResolution`: Pathways for surfacing and integrating breakdowns
- `rituals`: Optional cultural or memetic practices tied to participation
- `appliesPrinciples`: References to one or more **Core Prosocial Principles**

---

## üåø Grounding Scaffolds in Prosocial Principles

MAP Governance Scaffolds are inspired by the **Core Prosocial Principles** ‚Äî derived from Elinor Ostrom‚Äôs research on commons governance and evolved by the Prosocial World community.

By embedding these principles, MAP fosters:

- Psychological safety
- Transparent equity
- Adaptive, resilient structures
- Decentralized, life-aligned governance

## üß† The 8 Core Prosocial Principles in MAP Context

| **Principle**                      | **MAP Scaffold Implementation** |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1. **Shared Identity & Purpose**  | Spaces encode their LifeCode as a **memetic signature** in the scaffold. |
| 2. **Equitable Distribution of Costs & Benefits** | **Vital Capital Flows** and **Sustainability Quotients** track reciprocity and balance. |
| 3. **Inclusive & Fair Decision-Making** | Roles like **steward** and **weaver** facilitate processes such as consent rounds and advice protocols. |
| 4. **Monitoring Agreed Behaviors** | Promise fulfillment, contribution tracking, and role accountability are observable through Trust Channels. |
| 5. **Graduated Responses to Misalignment** | Tension protocols favor restorative paths: dialogue, pauses, role shifts. |
| 6. **Fast & Fair Conflict Resolution** | Circles, peer mediation, and conflict rituals transform breakdowns into deeper coherence. |
| 7. **Autonomy Within Nested Structures** | Every Space is a sovereign Holon ‚Äî governing itself while linking into larger fractals. |
| 8. **Collaborative Relationships with Other Groups** | Promise Weaves and shared Agreements enable inter-Space collaboration with clarity and care. |

## üåÄ Scaffold Examples (With Principle Alignment)

### 1. **Consent Circle Scaffold**
- Principles: 1, 3, 5, 7
- Emphasizes lightweight consent, shared purpose, minimal governance
- Roles: steward, weaver, participant
- Tension resolution: reflective rounds + pause protocols

### 2. **Advice Process Scaffold**
- Principles: 2, 3, 6, 7
- Any agent may act, but must seek advice from affected parties
- Encourages autonomy while maintaining connectedness

### 3. **Nested Circle Governance**
- Principles: 1 through 8 (full spectrum)
- Supports complex, scalable organizations through double-linking and clear domains
- Ideal for large fractal Spaces or multi-agent collaborations

## üìö Role Templates in Governance Scaffolds

| **Role**           | **Function** |
|--------------------|--------------|
| `steward`          | Holds coherence and facilitates governance cycles |
| `weaver`           | Maintains Promise Weaves and cross-role coordination |
| `membrane keeper`  | Manages trust levels, onboarding, and exits |
| `scribe`           | Records agreements, proposals, tensions, and amendments |
| `participant`      | Engages actively in Dances, Promises, governance |
| `observer`         | Witnesses without active roles (e.g., learners, auditors) |

Roles can be fixed, rotating, or entered into via consent and ritual.

## üìä DAHN Integration

DAHN modules surface Governance Scaffolds via:

- **Governance Console**: Roles, proposals, consent flows
- **Decision Map**: Visualizing scaffold-based decisions and amendments
- **Participation Pulse**: Measuring engagement, contribution, alignment
- **Principle Overview**: Scaffolds' alignment with Prosocial Principles
- **Tension Board**: Tracking, surfacing, and integrating breakdowns

---

## ü™¥ Evolving Governance Scaffolds

Scaffolds are **living holons** ‚Äî Spaces may:

- Fork and customize existing scaffolds
- Amend governance protocols over time
- Evolve governance rituals as culture deepens
- Contribute new scaffolds back to the MAP Commons

Every Scaffold Holon includes:

- Machine-readable schema
- Human-readable narrative
- Visual models (e.g., role graphs, governance flows)
- Provenance metadata (origin, adaptations, lineage)

---

## üìò Summary

Governance Scaffolds in MAP allow Spaces to:

- Coordinate with clarity
- Govern with consent
- Adapt with resilience
- Evolve collective wisdom

By rooting governance in the Core Prosocial Principles and making it **pluggable, memetic, and sovereign**, the MAP enables regenerative cooperation across scales.
