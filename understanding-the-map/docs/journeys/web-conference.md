# ‚ú® Scenario: Facilitating a Live Web Conference Using Meeting Center and Salience Visualizer in a Shared Bioregional Organizing Space ‚ú®

---

## Context:
You are hosting a **live web conference** in your shared **Bioregional Organizing Space** ‚Äî a Space created to support mutual aid, coordination, and regenerative action across your region.  
The gathering today includes organizers, community leaders, and regenerative project stewards.

At the start of the meeting, you want to **ground the participants** in shared **principles** ‚Äî the "group promises" ‚Äî that will guide how you move through the session together.

Because this is a live event, you are running the session through the **Meeting Center mapp** inside the shared Space.  
(As always in MAP, everything occurs **inside the membrane** of the Space ‚Äî maintaining sovereignty, trust, and control.)

---

## Action:
You open the **Meeting Center mapp** inside the **Bioregional Organizing Space** and launch the live session.

---

### **Phase 1: Ritual Grounding (Voting on Alive Principles)**
- The Meeting Center begins with a **Principles Ritual**:
    - Participants are invited to **vote** on which guiding principles feel *most alive* and *most important* for this meeting.
    - Example principles might include:
        - Mutual Empowerment
        - Deep Listening
        - Trust through Transparency
        - Emergent Adaptation
- Participants select their resonant principles via simple taps or clicks.

- As votes come in, the **Salience Visualizer** updates in **real time** to reflect collective attention:
    - Principles begin to pulse based on vote counts.
    - This shared visual feedback helps orient the group immediately toward shared intentions ‚Äî without long check-ins or side conversations.

---

### **Phase 2: Web Conference + Live Capture**
- The Meeting Center **hosts the full web conference session**:
    - Video/audio conferencing happens inside the Space membrane.
    - A **live transcript** of the meeting is captured in real-time.
- As the meeting progresses:
    - Important ideas, agreements, projects, names, and dates mentioned are **captured in the transcript**.
    - Facilitators or participants can optionally **highlight** or **tag** specific moments or phrases.

---

### **Phase 3: Knowledge Curation Pipeline**
- After (or during) the meeting:
    - The **live transcript** is treated as a **Knowledge Source**.
    - It is fed into the **Space's Knowledge Curation Pipeline**:
        - The **Notification Center** issues a new "Transcript Captured" event.
        - The **Knowledge Assistant mapp** wakes up, scans the transcript.
        - It cross-references content against the **Space‚Äôs Salience-Landscaped Categories** (principles, dates, projects, practices).
        - **Timestamped links** are created:
            - E.g., discussion about "Flow Funding Pilot" links to "Flow Funding Agreements" practice.
            - E.g., a reminder to finalize "Regenerative Finance Workshop" links to "Important Date: April 15."

---

### **Phase 4: Live and Post-Meeting Visualization**
- **During the meeting**:
    - The **Salience Visualizer**, integrated within the Meeting Center, continues to reflect the **results of the principles ritual in real time**.
    - Larger, faster-pulsing principles show which group promises are most alive as the meeting unfolds.
- **After the meeting**:
    - The Visualizer can switch modes to reflect **new knowledge objects and linkages** that emerged during discussion.
    - Categories like "Flow Funding Agreements" and "April 15: Finance Workshop" may now pulse, showing their activation.
- The **Salience Visualizer** is just one type of **MAP Graph Visualizer**. It filters the knowledge graph to show only holons above a **salience threshold**:
    - You can adjust this threshold dynamically via zooming or a salience slider.
    - This gives you flexible, focused access to either sharp emergent threads or slower-moving background themes.

---

### **Phase 5: Trust and Boundary Protection**
- All captured content ‚Äî video, transcript, knowledge objects, linkages, votes ‚Äî are stored **inside the Bioregional Organizing Space‚Äôs membrane**.
- No external servers, no cross-space leakage, no surveillance AI.
- The Space holds its own memory, its own attention landscape, and its own evolving life code ‚Äî in trust and sovereignty.

---

## üå± Hints of Power:
- **Co-Created Living Knowledge**: The meeting isn't just a moment ‚Äî it becomes a living part of the Space's evolving graph.
- **Salience-Adaptive Memory**: The group‚Äôs attention naturally curates what's important ‚Äî without needing heavy manual tagging.
- **Real-Time Visual Grounding**: Shared intention is made visible live, through collective principle pulses.
- **Sovereign Collective Intelligence**: All processing is internal to the Space, preserving sacred trust for vulnerable communities.

# üîπ System Touchpoints:
| Step | MAP Component | Action |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Ritual Launch | Meeting Center mapp | Initiate principle selection ritual |
| Visualize (Live) | Salience Visualizer | Show pulsing principles during meeting |
| Host | Meeting Center mapp | Run full web conference, capture transcript |
| Notify | Notification Center | Issue "New Transcript Captured" event |
| Curate | Knowledge Assistant mapp | Categorize and link key transcript elements |
| Visualize (Post) | Salience Visualizer | Show updated salience landscape |
| Protect | Space Membrane | Enforce group trust boundaries |

---

# üõ°Ô∏è Sovereign Group Flow:
The group‚Äôs shared experience is:
- Grounded in real-time awareness of what matters most,
- Captured and curated as shared memory,
- Reflected visually in both the moment and the aftermath,
- Protected within trusted, sovereign boundaries.

---

# üß≠ Summary:
A single live meeting ‚Äî  
grounded in shared principles, hosted within the Space membrane,  
captured and curated into living knowledge,  
and reflected back to the group in real time ‚Äî  
becomes a dynamic expression of collective coherence and care.

---

# üîÅ Shared Components, Reused Powerfully:
This meeting scenario ‚Äî with principles voting, transcript capture, curation, and salience reflection ‚Äî  
relies on the **exact same core components** used in personal journaling:

- The **Knowledge Curation Pipeline**
- The **Notification Center**
- The **Knowledge Assistant mapp**
- The **Salience Visualizer**

This shows the **generative power** of MAP‚Äôs design:  
a **small number of composable, membrane-respecting components**  
can support deeply personal reflection *and* highly coordinated group process ‚Äî  
with elegance, integrity, and minimal cognitive overhead.
