We meet at a time when the dominant systems of the modern world—systems built on extraction, enclosure, and commodification—are unraveling.

Ecological collapse, social fragmentation, and economic precarity are not distant threats; they are the lived reality of millions today.

Against this backdrop, the ancient and enduring practice of commoning reemerges not simply as a historical curiosity, but as a living necessity.

Commoning—rooted in shared stewardship, mutual care, and relational governance—offers pathways for communities to regenerate life, rebuild trust, and sustain shared resources in ways that markets and states have failed to do.

We honor the tradition of commoning as a deep inheritance, one that predates and will outlast the industrial economy.

Our intent is not to replace or control these practices, but to offer living, adaptable scaffolds that can help new commons form, flourish, and evolve—rooted in the wisdom of their own participants, responsive to the living world around them.

In a time when new forms of cooperation must arise quickly and resiliently, we believe that careful, relationally-rooted information systems can play a humble but meaningful role in supporting this emergence.
