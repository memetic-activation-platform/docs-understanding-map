# 💧 Vital Capital Flows in the MAP
### Modeling value as flow in regenerative coordination

---

## 🌱 What is Vital Capital?

In the MAP, **Vital Capital** refers to the **core forms of value that sustain and regenerate life** — across human, ecological, social, and technological systems. Rather than reducing value to money, MAP enables the flow of diverse capital types through consent-based Promises and Agreements.

> Vital Capital is the lifeblood of the MAP.  
> It is what moves when Cells make Promises, activate Dances, and join Agent Spaces.

MAP’s capital model draws from the work of:
- **Context-Based Sustainability (CBS)** (McElroy, 2008)
- **Multi-Capital Frameworks** in integrated reporting
- **Doughnut Economics** (Kate Raworth, 2017)
- **Regenerative Economics** (e.g. John Fullerton, Capital Institute)

These sources offer a **multi-capital lens** for understanding and tracking value beyond financial terms — which the MAP evolves into a **holon-native, flow-oriented implementation**.

## 🔠 Vital Capital Types

The MAP supports a rich typology of Vital Capital. This can be extended or customized by communities, but core types include:

| **Capital Type**       | **Description**                                                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Natural Capital**    | Ecosystem services, land, water, air, biodiversity                   |
| **Human Capital**      | Skills, labor, knowledge, health, attention                          |
| **Social Capital**     | Trust, reputation, relationships, group cohesion                     |
| **Cultural Capital**   | Stories, rituals, symbols, traditions, identity                      |
| **Built Capital**      | Tools, infrastructure, digital systems, physical resources           |
| **Financial Capital**  | Currency, tokens, credit, investment flows                           |
| **Experiential Capital** | Aesthetic, emotional, and lived experience                         |
| **Memetic Capital**    | Values, beliefs, narrative codes, memetic signatures                 |
| **Temporal Capital**   | Time, availability, scheduling attention                             |
| **Spiritual Capital**  | Purpose, presence, connection to meaning (optional but available)    |

## 🔁 Capital Flows in MAP Promises

Every **Promise** in MAP includes one or more **Vital Capital Flows**, specifying:

- `capitalType`: What kind of capital is flowing
- `direction`: Incoming / outgoing (from the issuer's perspective)
- `quantity`: Scalar (e.g. 10 hours), symbolic (e.g. “ongoing”), or subjective (“sufficient”)
- `conditions`: Rules or thresholds that gate the flow
- `impact`: Intended or observed outcomes of the flow

### Example:

```
"vitalCapitalFlows" : [
  {
    "capitalType": "Human Capital",
    "direction": "outgoing",
    "quantity": "4 hours/week",
    "conditions": ["trustLevel > 0.7"],
    "impact": "Skill development for youth members"
  },
  {
    "capitalType": "Social Capital",
    "direction": "incoming",
    "impact": "Strengthened mutual trust within community"
  }
]
```

## 🔄 Patterns of Flow

MAP supports several **flow archetypes**, encoded in Promise Types:

| **Pattern**             | **Description**                                                               |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Gift Flow**           | Unconditional giving (e.g. "I will share this resource freely.")              |
| **Reciprocal Flow**     | Mutual exchange based on parity or complementarity                            |
| **Mutualism**           | Coordinated flows for shared benefit (e.g. co-creation of a shared resource)  |
| **Stewardship Flow**    | One party promises to care for or maintain value on behalf of others          |
| **Commons Contribution**| Value flows into a collectively accessible pool                               |
| **Conditional Flow**    | Value flows only if certain criteria are met (e.g. trust, role, proposal outcome) |

These patterns shape how Vital Capital is **activated**, **trusted**, and **restored** over time.

## 📏 Thresholds, Sustainability Quotients, and Dashboards

To support meaningful regenerative coordination, the MAP integrates key ideas from **Context-Based Sustainability (CBS)**, including:

- **Sustainability Thresholds**: Concrete boundaries (ecological, social, economic) that define what constitutes a *sustainable state* for a Cell.
- **Sustainability Quotients**: Measurements that relate a Cell’s actual performance to its sustainability thresholds.
- **Dashboards**: Interfaces in DAHN that surface these metrics to support awareness, feedback, and intentional design.

> 🧠 *A Cell is sustainable to the extent that its resource flows and behaviors remain within the thresholds that define what it can justly and safely take, give, or impact — in context.*

---

### 🔹 What Is a Threshold?

A **Threshold** defines the **contextually appropriate limit** for a particular Vital Capital flow or stock. This may be:

- **Ecological**: How much fresh water can be used without degrading the watershed?
- **Social**: What is the minimum level of human care required for dignity within a community?
- **Economic**: What resource balances ensure viability without extraction?

Thresholds are defined **per capital type**, and may be set by:
- Collective Cell governance
- Commons stewardship policies
- Scientific or traditional knowledge
- Memetic codes embedded in Life Code

---

### 🔹 Sustainability Quotient (SQ)

The **Sustainability Quotient** is calculated by comparing a Cell’s **actual Vital Capital usage or contribution** against its **threshold**:

```
Sustainability Quotient (SQ) = Actual Impact / Contextual Threshold
- If SQ ≤ 1 → the flow is **within sustainable bounds**
- If SQ > 1 → the flow **exceeds** the sustainable threshold (overshoot)
```

Each Vital Capital type can have its own **SQ**, giving a **multi-dimensional view of sustainability**.

> 🌿 *MAP doesn’t reduce sustainability to a single score — it provides a mosaic of context-aware indicators.*

---

### 🔹 Example: Water Use

- **Natural Capital: Water**
- Threshold: 50L/day/person based on regional replenishment rate
- Actual use: 40L/day/person
- SQ: 40 ÷ 50 = **0.80** → Sustainable (20% headroom)

In DAHN, this would show up in the **Capital Compass Dashboard** as:
- A green arc with 80% fill
- Optional narrative: “Usage within sustainable limits”
- Suggestion: "Consider offering surplus water access as a Commons Promise"

---

### 🔹 Capital Dashboards for Every Cell

Every Cell — individual or collective — can activate **Dashboards** in DAHN to monitor:

| **Dimension**          | **What It Shows**                                            |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Vital Capital Flow** | Inflows and outflows by type (daily, weekly, cumulative)     |
| **Capital Stocks**     | What is being stored, cultivated, depleted                   |
| **Sustainability Quotients** | Contextual performance vs. thresholds                     |
| **Trend Arcs**         | Velocity and directionality of capital movement              |
| **Alerts / Prompts**   | Notifications when nearing thresholds or experiencing overshoot |
| **Regenerative Insights** | Suggestions for restorative Promises or capital exchanges   |

These Dashboards are **configurable**, **privacy-respecting**, and may be:
- Fully private (for self-awareness)
- Shared selectively with Agent Spaces
- Used as inputs to governance decisions (e.g. capacity to take on a new role)

---

### 🔹 Sources of Threshold Definitions

MAP enables Cells to **define or adopt threshold models** appropriate to their context:

- **Ecological**: planetary boundaries, bioregional thresholds, permaculture principles
- **Social**: dignity floors, mutual aid agreements, care covenants
- **Economic**: contribution minimums, non-extractive pricing models
- **Cultural**: time for ritual, space for story, respect for silence

Thresholds are defined in **self-describing holons**, and may be:
- Versioned
- Co-governed
- Aligned with memeplexes or value codes

---

### 🔹 Application in Promises and Agreements

Promises and Agreements can reference thresholds:

- “This Promise is only active if the Cell’s Human Capital SQ is < 1”
- “This Agreement includes a clause for restorative flows if Memetic Capital falls below threshold”
- “Water sharing will be paused when SQ > 1.1 and restored when SQ < 0.9”

This enables **responsiveness to context** — not abstract commitments.

---

## 🧭 Why This Matters

Most systems today track value **without context**. MAP ensures:

- Value flows are measured **relative to what's just and regenerative**
- Sovereign agents have the tools to **understand their impact**
- Coordination can be driven by **shared thresholds**, not just transactions

> MAP’s sustainability model is not a top-down metric — it’s a **living membrane of feedback and consent**, enabling Cells to thrive in coherence with each other and the world.

## 📊 Flow Tracking and Impact

Vital Capital Flows can be:

- **Observed** by peers or stewards
- **Visualized** using DAHN modules (e.g. the Capital Compass)
- **Summarized** in Weaves or Collective Cell dashboards
- **Visualized** with timelines, Sankey diagrams, or graph overlays

### Impact Awareness

Each flow may optionally include:

- **Intended Impact**: the goal or purpose of the flow
- **Observed Impact**: narrative or quantitative feedback
- **Replenishment Policy**: how the capital will be renewed (if applicable)

This allows **capital-aware decision-making**, such as:

- Pausing new Promises if a capital type is overdrawn
- Rebalancing within an Agent Space
- Inviting support or restoration from allied Cells

## 🔎 Open Threads for Vital Capital Design

### 1. **Quantification & Subjectivity**
How do we model subjective capital (e.g. trust, care, presence) without oversimplifying or abstracting away its richness?

### 2. **Capital Health & Balance**
What tools or visualizations help a Cell or Collective Cell know:
- What’s flowing in/out?
- What’s depleted or thriving?
- What needs replenishment?

### 3. **Emergent Capital Types**
How can communities define their own capital ontologies (e.g. Ritual Capital, Ancestral Capital) and make them interoperable?

### 4. **Reputation and Feedback**
How do we track fulfillment and impact of capital flows without coercion or surveillance?

### 5. **Collective Flow Governance**
What scaffolds and protocols allow Agent Spaces to:
- Define policies for commons contributions
- Steward pooled capital responsibly
- Encourage reciprocal, regenerative flows?

## 💡 Why Vital Capital?

By modeling value as flow — not as static assets — the MAP supports:

- Regenerative economics
- Transparent coordination
- Adaptive governance
- Distributed decision-making
- Systemic trust and resilience

> MAP doesn't just move information or money.  
> It flows *what matters* — care, knowledge, trust, story, time, and presence.
